            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader, I preſent vnto thy view the Embleame of thy temporall life, Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>(nihil enim noui ſub ſole)</hi> &amp; a ſoueraigne preſeruatiue of thy ſpirituall life, which is holy meditation, the indigeſted crudities of theſe times, occaſioned by rawe ſtudy and ſuperficiall prayer, ſend vp ſuch groſſe fumes into the head, and breede ſuch wayward ſpirits in the heart, as in matters of Religion, doe make the greater ſort, euen at mans eſtate, to <hi>thinke as a childe,</hi> to <hi>ſpeake as a childe,</hi> with no leſſe ignorance then contention. A ſtrange preuarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the childrens game in jeſt, ſhould prooue good earneſt amongſt men. <hi>Cock ſodden halfe eaten:</hi> ſurely the moſt, that know any thing, doe liue vpon the ſwimme, and thinke the firſt ſeething of the pot to be ſufficient, wanting the maturity of deeper meditation. Sweet Ieſu, how is thy net rent, and great fiſhes ſlip out, for want of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? How many diuiſions, and ſubdiuiſions doth thy ſeameleſſe coate endure? Indeed, in earthly things, variety is cauſe of pleaſure, but in caſe of Religion, variety is the mother of nullity, a poſition no whit paradoxall, being grounded vpon a principle of ſecular policie it ſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed euen by the God of wiſdome, ſaying, That <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diuided againſt it ſelfe</hi> (there is variety) <hi>cannot ſtand,</hi> there is the nullity. The <hi>Lutheran,</hi> the <hi>Caluiniſt,</hi> the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> the <hi>Browniſt,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> make the Diuels <hi>Sett of fine Parts,</hi> conſiſting of diſcords; who alwayes running Diuiſion in a wrong key vpon the plain ſong of Scripture, doe marre the ſoule, which God made a harmony; yea, and all the muſick too in the Church of God; and which is the

               </gap> monſtrouſly predicated of, that it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poted of incompatible contradictions. Theſe are much like ſo many race-Poaſts, that ſteppe before each other a mile in madneſſe (for that is diſtraction) and he that runs the courſe ouer, is ſure to ouer-runne the Conſtable; and is ſure to runne his ſight out, though not out of ſight; which euery pious minde, and ſtudious of the Churches weale, cannot but hartily wiſh might ſoone betide them.</p>
            <p>But now behold again; although in reſpect of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſaſterous iſſue of theſe wicked deſignes, Ipitie theſe men more, then they doe themſelues: yet I ſhame to ſee the ground, and firſt originall of this intoxication. And what? haue they neither hearts, nor fore-heads for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? not a <hi>Ianus</hi> amongſt them to looke behinde, and before, whence and whither? good God, that neither pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor ſhame, is able to ſtrike one notch into their whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heads, to ſtop thoſe exentrick motions of a brain-ſick giddineſſe, whoſe puniſhment condigne, and ſutable to the ſinne, muſt be a whirle-pit. But I haue almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my ſelfe, being rapt beyond meaſure, when I ſeriouſly meditate vpon thoſe woful aberrations. The thing, I would vtter, is this. Aske a Sectary (Puritane, Browniſt, or other) the ground of his opinion, and he laies you downe a Bible, and many words makes he of the Word, which he will be tryed by, though for the ſenſe therof, in concluſion, it muſt be tried by him, and he vntutored, ſlaue to his owne ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low weenings, will bee hammering out ſome improper word, of his owne proper forge, and appropriate it to that moſt ſacred Word it ſelfe; and then preſently preuent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, by curſing his Aduerſary, that ſhall adde, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from it. This, oh this is it, that makes me bluſh, for their impudencie, laugh at their folly, and grieue at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, done to thoſe heauen-inſpired Oracles, yea that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:16409:3"/>Spirit of God himſelfe, by thoſe fanaticall enthuſiaſme.</p>
            <p>I could ſpeake vpon mine owne experience very much in diſcouery of this folly and impiety, (and to diſcouer it, is to refute it): but I may not exceed the limits of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and future occaſion may offer it ſelfe for more ample diſcourſe herein. For the preſent, I hartily deſire thee (good courteous and Chriſtian Reader) to learne truely, and exactly, what that Scripture meaneth, by teſtifying of it ſelfe, That <hi>no ſcripture is of any priuate interpretation.</hi> Next, to that rule put this example, ſet before the eyes of thine imagination, the ſects aboue mentioned, with all the petty rioters, calued out of them; and (if thou canſt haue patience to endure the while) ſuppoſe alſo the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures laid in common before them, then let them demand each of other, from the firſt to the laſt, and reciprocally, what infallible aſſurance and warrant they haue, to builde their particular opinions, different amongſt themſelues, &amp; impugned by the demander, vpon ſuch and ſuch places of ſacred Writ, as they pretend; and it is not to bee vttered, what a ſpirit of contradiction thou ſhalt ſoone diſcerne in them vpon ſtrict examination, and yet what a ſpirit of flumber too, that all this while they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
            <p>But to leaue thoſe out-flying hunters, which the Church (if it were ſo well manned, as to top them) ſhould whip in at the firſt breaking our, or whippe out at laſt for euer comming in againe. It is now high time to turne my ſpeech to thee, good Chriſtian, that with true humility, &amp; vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſincerity ſeekeſt the plain way to heauen, &amp; thy ſoules happineſſe. To render thee a general account of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſigne; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that this Treatiſe is choſen by me, amongſt many other, for that it ſomething concernes that point of the warrant of holy Scripture, before touched, as being founded thereupon, and ſeconded alſo by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Doctors in the firſter age of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Church. Beſides, the moſt of thoſe places alledged (and there be 14. of them in all) are ſo profound in ſearch,
<pb facs="tcp:16409:4"/>ſo pleaſant in the finding, ſo correſpondent in the Type, ſo reuerend in the Myſtery, ſo euery way abſolute, as (ſetting all controuerſies aſide, with the which I will not medle) I profeſſe I could not hold off my hands from tranſlating, though it were for my owne priuate vſe, onely to keepe me both from idleneſſe, and from employments of inferiour condition. And after peceiuing that, whereas I intended to make the Tranſlation onely leſſe priuate, ſome were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endeauouring to make it altogether publike; for the worthy reſpect I muſt euer beare to the firſt moouer hereunto, and the generall good of my owne Countrey, in the encreaſe of piety and true deuotion; I was ſooner yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereunto, as being not a little glad, that my poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould euer prooue to be accounted worthy of the Churches acceptance. Now my greateſt feare is, leſt I haue done the Author himſelfe ſome wrong through the tenuity of my skill. I muſt confeſſe, I haue not been apprentiſe to this trade of tranſlating, nor did I euer breath that ſtranger ayre of <hi>France;</hi> what I haue got herein, is by my trauailes at home. Beſides, thoſe that are wel practiſed in this courſe, wil yeeld me that the elegancy of ſpeech, vſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, is by diffrence of language much abated in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, be in neuer ſo exact; yet my hope is, I haue giuen you the ſame man ſtill, though in an Engliſh habite; and though the manner of the ſtile be changed yet the matter of the book is the ſame it was. Thou haſt heere my feares, and my hopes, take my prayers alſo with thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) in ſtead of a bleſſing vpon thy peruſall hereof, and if it like thee, giue me thine againe in change, for further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: it is all I craue of thee for my paines; thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not deny theſe prayers to thine enemy, though hee skorne them, ſure thou canſt not, but giue them thy friend, that begs them, and deſires to reſt</p>

            <head>THE PRINTER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader: Whereas the Deſcriptions whereupon the ſeuerall parts of this work are framed, doe ſuppoſe as thou wilt finde ſo many painted Tables of the matters themſelues deſcribed in them, to bee ſet, as it were, before thine eyes, which the Author himſelfe, in his French booke, thought good to ſupply with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny printed Pictures prefixed before them: I haue beene induced, by the aduice of others, to omit thoſe Pictures altogether, for the reaſons heere mentioned.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe hauing receiued order to procure them from the French Preſſe. I found the ſtamps ſo ouer-worne by meanes of a ſecond Edition, which came foorth at the ſame time, that I thought the Pictures not worth the buying.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe when they were firſt printed, though no doubt they were done with great arte: yet were they ſo defectiue, not onely for want of colour, but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the worke it ſelfe, that the Printer was faine to excuſe them in a Note to the Reader, remitting him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for the better vnderſtanding of thoſe ſtories preſented in them, to the Authors Deſcriptions of thoſe Painted Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which he faineth to haue before the eyes of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Whereby it appeareth, that the printed Pictures came farre ſhort of the Authors Deſcriptions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerued to little purpoſe, not being able to expreſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of thoſe things, which the Author deſcribeth, as contained in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe the deſcriptions themſelues, are ſo glorious, ſo liuely, and ſo compleate, as there is no need
<pb facs="tcp:16409:6"/>of the Pictures; which therefore, though eaſily perceiued to be miſſing, can no way be thought wanting by any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader: eſpecially conſidering, that ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made to ſupply the want of thoſe Painted Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which they deſcribe; as Pictures againe were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſupply the office of Deſcriptions. The Painted Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being nothing elſe but a viſible report, or a certaine kind of ſpeech to the eye of the beholder: as the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof againe is fitly tearmed by our Author in his Prologue, a certaine Picture deuiſed for the eare of the Reader. The Orator or Poet, no leſſe then the Painter, endeauouring to beget with pleaſure and delight, a liuely conceit of thoſe things in vs, which their Deſcriptions and Pictures doe ſet before vs. Wherefore, if eyther of them be excellent, there is no need of the other: and to ioyne a Picture to the Deſcription of a Picture, is in a ſort to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them both, and to ſhew in effect, that they are both defectine. And I doubt not, that <hi>Philoſtrat as</hi> himſelfe, whom our Author was content to imitate, would haue taken it very ill at his hands, who for the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Deſcriptions, ſhould haue thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to haue had thoſe Pictures added, which he deſcribeth as preſent before the eyes of his Reader.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons therefore, if it were not the beſt, I hope thou wilt not iudge it to be much amiſſe, that I haue altogether omitted thoſe Printed Tables, being in truth no leſſe defectiue then ſuperfluous, in reſpect of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Deſcriptions, which of the two are farre the better Pictures.</p>
            <p>That which doth more conceme me, is to excuſe ſome faults of mine owne, which haue eſcaped mee heere and there, in the Printing of this notable Worke, the Copie which was ſent mee being very ſoule; and hauing no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by mee that could correct mee. All that I can doe at this preſent in ſatisfaction thereof, is onely to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular confeſſion, or recantation of them; which you
<pb facs="tcp:16409:6"/>ſhall finde in the latter end of this Booke, ſet downe in ſuch manner, as thou mayeſt eaſily reforme them in thy reading: for the number of the page and line where the error is being noted there, will eaſily ſhew thee how to mend it. And ſo deſiring Almighty God to pardon alſo thoſe ſecret faults of thine, with the reſt of mine, which I feare are farre the greater. I bid thee hartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

Moreouer, why God would that in the Law of Nature, and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there ſhould bee ſet downe ſo liuely Figures of the myſteries appertaining to the Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>By the firſt declaration we ſhall haue a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe <hi>Pictures,</hi> which hereafter ſhall bee decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs more particularly. By the ſecond wee ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that God hath moſt wiſely vſed this faſhion to teach vs his Law, as well for the manifeſtation of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as alſo for the profit of his children, which are the two feete or Baſes, whereon our <hi>Figures</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>Firſt then we are to note,<note place="margin">Naturall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</note> that a <hi>Picture</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> if we take it naturally, doth according to the name ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the exterior forme of ſome body. So as the outward forme, the lineaments, and the proportion of the parts of a Plant, of a Beaſt, or a Man, is a figure of each of theſe; but a naturall figure,<note place="margin">Artificiall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</note> of which we ſpeake not heere, this ſubiect appertaining to the Naturaliſts. Wherefore according to our ſenſe and meaning heere, it is a thing made or framed to repreſent and ſignifie another thing; and this is an artificiall Figure, otherwiſe called a <hi>Picture,</hi> of which we finde three ſorts.<note place="margin">Dumbe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note> The firſt is that, which to our eyes repreſenteth by lineaments and colours ſome things without words, called for this cauſe by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Dumbe Pictures:</hi> ſuch are the Images as well of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſted worke, as of painted fables.<note place="margin">

Of this ſort alſo are the Viſions framed in our Imagination; for though theſe be in ſome ſort ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16409:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>yet notwithſtanding in the likenes of corporal obiects, ſo they are repreſented to the ſight of our inward ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of <hi>Pictures</hi> ſerues for the eare,<note place="margin">Speaking Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note> and for that qualitie we may call them <hi>Speaking Pictures;</hi> ſuch are the deſcriptions or fictions which the Poets or Hiſtorians make in words of a Tree, of a Riuer, of a liuing Creature, of a Tempeſt, of a Vertue, of a Vice, or of other imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things. This ſort containes alſo the declarations which are made to explane ſome artificial figures either preſent, or fained as preſent. Such are the diſcourſes of <hi>Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for in them there is neither colour nor painting, but the bare word which faines the Images and Figures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers the phantaſies of the Author, as hauing the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures before his eyes.</p>
            <p>The third ſort of figures are any things or actions inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to repreſent other myſteries.<note place="margin">Allegoricall or myſticall Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</note> And if the myſterie be ciuill or prophane, the Figure is ciuill or prophane; as was the <hi>Hierogliphes</hi> of the old <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> conſiſting in certaine figures of beaſts, or of inſtruments, put for to ſignifie ſome hidden thing; as a Crocodile was the figure of a Traytor; the Eagle the figure of the ſoule. But if it be a myſtery of Religion, it is an holy figure. So Manna was an holy Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, not in regard of colours or of words; but of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſo Circumciſion was an action ſignifying and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Baptiſme. This kinde of Figure is otherwiſe called an Allegorie, that is to ſay, a myſticall Picture, containing in it ſelfe a ſpirituall ſenſe, knowne to ſpirituall people, and hid to the rude. This laſt ſort makes the fundamentall ſubiect of our holy Tables or Pictures of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> For our principall end is to explane the things, and the remarkable actions inſtituted in the Law of Nature, and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſignifie the Sacrifice and Sacrament of the body of our Sauiour. Notwithſtanding in diſplaying the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of theſe figures, we haue ſerued our ſelues of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two kindes of Pictures; that is to ſay, of the <hi>Dumbe Picture</hi> in the printed figures themſelues; and of the <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16409:10"/>Picture,</hi> in our deſcriptions or declarations of them. We haue alſo made many excurſions in recommendation of Vertue, and in deteſtation of Vice, for the inſtitution of manners; and often encited the Reader to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loue of the celeſtiall countrey; touching by this meanes the foure Cardinall Senſes,<note place="margin">

And in this faſhion haue wee comprehended foure ſorts of Expoſitions, and three ſorts of Pictures, to teach with fruit and pleaſure the moſt great myſtery of our Religion: for if there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor profitable Methods, then theſe foure: and if there bee nothing more delightfull then a picture, not which makes a thing glide more ſweetly within the ſoule then a picture: nor which more profoundly engraues it in the memorie: nor more effectually calls foorth the will to loue or hate any obiect, good or euill, which to it ſhall be propoſed: I ſee not in what manner one can more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, liuely, and delitiouſly teach the vertues, the fruits, and the delicateneſſe of this diuine and holy meate, of the body of the Sonne of God, then with the aboue named Expoſitions, and with this triple picture of the penſell of the Word and of the ſignification.</p>
            <p>If my labour in this excellent matter,<note place="margin">To all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Writers.</note> (truely Chriſtian, and worthy of the attention of all honorable men) bring any profit or luſter to our faith, or to the publike weale, as I deſire with all my heart it ſhould: all the praiſe be to God, which hath furniſhed me with ſpirit and body, inke and paper, to write thereof. And if by the example of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16409:10"/>theſe Pictures any men of good ſpirit take occaſion to vſe the like method, in diſcourſing pleaſantly on ſome worthy ſubiect, to teach with honeſt recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; profit, the means to follow Vertue, and flye Vice; I ſhall receiue my part thereby of ſingular contentment and ſolace, and they their recompence of honor and glory, from the hand of him, which neuer leaues any good worke done for his name without reward; nor any ill committed againſt his Lawes, without puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Truely (to ſay this by the way) it is a miſery as worthy of compaſſion as ſhame, that ſo many Poets and Orators amongſt Chriſtians, and namely heere in <hi>France,</hi> Employ the goodneſſe and fruitfulneſſe of their ſpirits, to write tales and fables, of Loue, and other things, either vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or pernitious, and who like to Spiders (that draw out their owne bowels in making copwebs to catch Flies) doe occupie themſelues in ſuch vanities, letting paſſe a thouſand faire ſubiects, vpon which they might with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall praiſe, both learnedly and eloquently write. It is a great ſhame to the name of Chriſtians, to ſee a Pagan <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus,</hi> an <hi>Euripides,</hi> a <hi>Virgil,</hi> an <hi>Appelles,</hi> a <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> and other like prophane Authors, trauaile ſo carefully to ſet foorth, ſing, paint, and repreſent their Captains, their Acts, their Gods, their Vices, and their Vanities, for the glory of their ſuperſtition: and that many Chriſtians know not how to chooſe, neither matter nor maner a greeing to their name, for to write Chriſtianly to the praiſe of the true God, or to the honor and illuſtration of their onely true Religion. A thing yet farre more vnworthy, and yet moſt deplorable it is, to ſee others temper their penſel and their pen in the ſinke and puddle of prophane things,<note place="margin">Pictures of ſcandall.</note> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pictures of abomination and ſcandall, and to write and paint foorth ſuch fooleries, and vilonies as they doe, more prophanely, then the prophaneſt themſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care of loſing their ſoules; ſo they may gaine ſome brute of reputation amongſt the lighter ſort. And what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16409:11"/>lamentable folly is it to purchaſe at ſo deare a rate the ſmoake of vanitie? to incurre ignominy and eternall paine, only to haue their names ſwimme in the mouthes and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of fooles, for cunning Artizans of folly. But let vs come to the ſecond point of our introduction, and declare wherefore God hath of old vſed ſuch Figures going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of Grace.</p>

            <head>THE CAVSES, VSES, AND EFFECTS of Pictures and Figures in holy <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT remaines yet to declare according to our power, wherefore the Diuine prouidence would vſe fore-going Figures in the Law of Nature and <hi>Moſes,</hi> before that hee ſent his Son, to eſtabliſh his owne Law in his proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Whereof we giue this reaſon in generall, that it was to declare that he is God; and for the more profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his creature in this point. And thus we prooue what we haue ſaid. It is the familiar manner of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to perfect his admirable workes vpon little prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſmal beginnings;<note place="margin">God workes by little prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> therby to make it appeare that he is God in little things, as well as in great, and no leſſe in the firſt beginning and going forward, then in the end and concluſion of his worke.</p>
            <p>In creating the world, he began it of nothing, and in the gouernment thereof hee continueth the propagation of his creatures, by meanes of their ſeede, which in a manner is alſo no thing. For, which is worthy of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this little ſeede containes in its littleneſſe, all that which is to be borne out of it afterwards. This Method of God is very fit to maniſeſt clearely his wiſedome, power, and bountie; and very proper, ſweetely to make himſelfe knowne vnto man, according to his capacitie. Who ſees a faire great Palme-tree well branched, thicke of boughes.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16409:11"/>and loaden with Palmes; hath hee not, wherefore to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Creator in this creature? but hee who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the little ſtone, from whence all this come forth,<note place="margin">Their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end.</note> the roote the body, the branches, the leaues, and the fruit of this tree; will magnifie on the one ſide his diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which ſecretly proceeding from ſuch a beginning, to ſuch an end, from ſuch imperfection, to ſuch perfection, teacheth properly the greatneſſe of it ſelfe, by the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the littleneſſe, whereon it wrought: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide, he will no leſſe admire his infinite vertue, which of ſo little a ſprout could produce ſuch a goodly tree, then praiſe his bountie, which in fine hath made a Preſent of all this for the vſe of man.</p>
            <p>This manner of proceeding is as cleare as meruailous in all the parts of this vniuerſall world: but thriſe illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and thriſe admirable it is in that Monarchie, which God the Sonne hath eſtabliſhed in the rule of his Church; whereof the foundations haue been meruailous in the Law of Nature; the progreſſe yet more meruailous vnder the Law of the Iewes, but the accompliſhment made in the Law of Grace, ſurpaſſeth all admiration. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Law of Nature, and the progreſſe in that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> are meruail ous, becauſe that in their littleneſſe they containe the modell and the figure of the greatneſſe of our Sauiours Law: and in this Law of our Sauiour, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment is infinitely more admirable, becauſe it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the perfection of all that, which of old was conceiued and figured in the other Lawes that went before it. And this is it which the Scripture ſets before vs ſo often, as a cleare demonſtration of the Maieſty, and greatneſſe of our Creator. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, that all things chanced in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure to the Iewes, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> that the old Law was a Picture of the new; and our Sauiour proteſteth often, that he will accompliſh the Law, euen to a little lot,<note place="margin">One ior. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18.</note> meaning that the Law of Grace was a moſt abſolute accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other Lawes before it.</p>

In the firſt place, foretelling that which was to enſue, hee hath ſhewed to haue preſent before his eyes, all things, were they paſſed, or to come; a ſigne of ſupreame dignitie. For without this knowledge, he could not haue ordained and foretold theſe ſo great, and ſo faire deſignes of ſo many myſteries, which were not to be effected till after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing of many thouſand yeeres; neither haue pointed out the Lineaments of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and haue made in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a body of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which repreſented the Law of the Meſſias, as we ſee he hath.</p>

            <p>Who then could know how to draw theſe ſo Diuine draughts from time to time,<note place="margin">S. Cyril. de Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione.</note> from ſeaſon to ſeaſon; except he which holds in his vnderſtanding, the knowledge and the face of times and ſeaſons, and of all things, paſſed, preſent, and to come?

And with ſo faire, iuſt, and equall proportion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the worke from point to point, according to the firſt deſigne, except he which can all that he will?</p>
            <p>As this manner of working by little beginnings and figures, ariſing to perfection, and to the truth it ſelfe, by meanes proportioned, both to the beginning, and to the ending, was conuenient to witneſſe the Maieſtie of God: ſo alſo it was neceſſary for to iuſtruct the Iewes, when the Law was in her childe-hood, and meruailouſly proper to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16409:12"/>perfect the Chriſtians, when it came to the perfection of mans eſtate. Theſe Iewes were rude, like yong children: and therefore their Law was a Schoole-maſter. God taught them by Figures; threatened them with the whip: promiſed them milke and hony; thus were they taught according to their capacitie, bridled with their owne bitt, and drawne by their owne cords, which were moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with their owne diſpoſitions.<note place="margin">Plato.</note> 
               <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith that yong people ought to begin their Schoole with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematikes, becauſe it is a Science which teacheth them by things agreeable to their wits, by lines, by triangles, ſquares, rulers, figures, which enter ſweetely into their ſpirits. The Iewes then being children, were to be taught Religion, by figures of Religion, as familiar Alphabets to their infancie; and ſuch was the vſage of them amongſt the Iewes; but with Chriſtians it is farre otherwiſe. If the Iewes fed vpon Figures, by vvhich they vvere taught; as their Paſchall Lambe, their Manna, their Sacrifices, their Offerings, and their other more remarkable ſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they were ſpirituall, they did contemplate the future truth of the Law of Grace; the Chriſtians doe not ſo, but contrariwiſe they hold the truth it ſelfe preſent, and in it they contemplate the Figures paſt, without any more vſing of them after the manner of the Iewes. From which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation they draw to themſelues many good vſes. The firſt whereof is, That they admire this ſupreme wiſdome of God, who hath from the beginning ſo vvell grounded the Kingdome of his Sonne, and conducted it to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Law of Grace, from ſo little beginnings in appearance, and yet ſo great in ſignification; ſeeing hee hath ſo diuinely laid the liuely and laſt colours of the Law of Grace, vpon thoſe ſhaddowes and lineaments which he had drawne before in the Lawes of olde.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that they admire the ſelfe-ſame wiſdom, contemplating the faire report of the nevv and old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one another, beholding each other, like the two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16409:13"/>Cherubims vvhich vvere turned face to face before the Arke; the one containing the true portraiture, the other the liuely truth; the one ſaying the Meſſias ſhall come, the other, the Meſſias is come,; the one the Meſſias ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the death of the Croſſe, the other the Meſſias hath endured the death of the Croſſe: the one the Meſſias ſhall inſtitute an eternall Sacrament, and Sacrifice of his body, the other that hee hath inſtituted the eternall Sacrament and Sacrifice of his body, and ſo of other myſteries.</p>
            <p>Theſe two admirations bring vs three other fruits. Firſt, they illuſtrate our faith; for when the myſteries which we beleeue are declared to vs by Figures and Prophecies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen many ages agoe, our faith takes foundation and roote vpon the authoritie and certaintie of things paſt. And this is the reaſon why the Scripture (to plant this faith in the heart of the hearer) ſendeth him ſo often to the Tables and Teſtimonies of the ancient Law. So our Sauiour go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to make a faithfull Chriſtian of his ſecret Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan <hi>3.</hi> Num. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> illuſtrates the myſtery of his Paſſion by the hiſtorie of the Serpent of Braſſe, long before erected in the Deſert, to be a Figure of his Paſſion; ſo inſinuated he the victory of his Reſurrection, by the ſhipwrack and comming forth of <hi>Ionas</hi> out of the Whales belly:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ionas. Iona.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.19.</note> ſo the Euangeliſts and the Apoſtles vſe often the witneſſe of the old Teſtament, to giue foote and credit to the faith they preached.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Figures confirme our hope, for ſeeing that which God hath ſo long before figured and foretold, is faithfully accompliſhed, wee are induced to hope that what is yet to come as the iudgement, the Reward the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the paine and the reſt, ſhall be likewiſe accompliſhed with the ſame fidelitie.</p>
            <p>Finally, they inflame our loue tovvards God, becauſe this contemplation of the ancient Figures, reported to the preſent truth, maketh vs ſee the eternall charitie vvith vvhich God hath loued vs, preparing for vs by ſo long
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16409:13"/>Preſcience, the Good which in the end he hath giuen vs; and ſtill promiſing vs more to come hereafter. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe loue and benefits engender loue, here-hence it is, that if wee be not vnnaturall, wee encreaſe in our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards God by this meditation. Theſe are the cauſes, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and vſe of Figures. It remaines to enter into the Temple of God, there to ſee the holy Pictures of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and Sacrifice of the body of his Sonne, drawne from the writings of his holy Teſtament, explained by his owne Word, and that according to the Doctrine of his Diuine Painters and Writers, the Interpreters of his Word; the dumbe Picture ſhall be for your eyes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them for your eares; and the expoſition of one and of the other, ſhall ſerue for your ſpirits or vnderſtandings.

This is that faire and ſpacious Region that the Painter repreſents to you in this Table or Picture. It is high in ſeate, rich in goodneſſe, rare in beautie, gratious in habitation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant in all forts of delights. The earth in ſome quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof is leuelled into a plaine champion field; and in other places raiſed vp in little harrowes or hilles, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with plants and trees of excellent goodneſſe. In the place where it is higheſt, you may there marke a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which riſing in great bubbles, is formed into a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, winding and watering all the Garden: towards the end whereof, it is diuided into foure heads, and maketh foure great ſlouds, running into diuers quarters of the earth. The firſt of which, is called <hi>Phiſon,</hi> caſting vpon the ſhoare her golden ſands, and many faire pretious ſtones, but no perſon gathered them vp, becauſe there was none as yet but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> in the world; their children, you may imagine, will not loſe them for want of gathering. The ayre there is moſt pure and ſubtill: and therefore we ſee not any token of clouds or miſts, the Sun ſhining cleare and bright alwayes. As for the fire which is of elements the moſt ſupreame, it holds it ſelfe ſtill and quiet in its kingdome aboue the ayre; yet contributing,

               <p>THe portraitures, and lineaments of the reſemblances, and likeneſſe, that is betweene our Sacrament and the Tree of Life, are theſe that follow. The Tree of Life was the Tree of Trees, that is to ſay, the collection of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all trees and plants, as man of all creatures, and the Sunne of all lights: the body of Ieſus Chriſt alſo, is the moſt noble of all bodies, the rich ſtorehouſe of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and the treaſure of the Diuinitie it ſelfe; conceiued in Virgin earth by the worke of the holy Spirit, and borne of a Virgin; a Body, wherein dwelleth truely the fulneſſe of all goodneſſe.<note place="margin">S. Aug. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cont. aduerſ. legis. cap. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> The Sacrament alſo of this body, is the collection of all the ancient Sacraments and Sacrifices, and for this cauſe, Sacrament of Sacraments, and Sacrifice of Sacrifices; as the Tree of Life was the Tree of Trees, and the Fruite of Fruites; Sacrament, truely planted in the midſt of the Church, that is to ſay, lifted vp to a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height amongſt the other celeſtiall myſteries; as the Tree of Life was planted in the midſt and moſt eminent place of the Garden, among the other Trees.</p>
               <p>The Tree of Life was ordained, not to nouriſh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by little and little, as did the other fruits, but for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16409:18"/>all the defects thereof at once, to render it vigorous, to giue it a perfect life without end, and to nouriſh it in the higheſt degree, that a body can poſſibly be nouriſhed. Even ſo the body of our Sauiour is left in refection to his Church, not to ſuſtaine vs after the faſhion of corruptible meates, which are conuerted into the ſubſtance of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but rather to conuert our bodies into it, imprinting in them his diuine qualities, and giuing them a liuing ſpring of immortalitie; according to that which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid, <hi>Hee that eateth this bread ſhall liue eternally:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The tree of life was no where to bee found, but onely within the incloſed earthily Paradiſe; neither was there any more then one alone; the Sacrifice alſo, and Sacrament of the body of our Sauiour is not made, but in his Church, by ſuch as are lawfully called thereunto; and if it be found amongſt Heretikes, they haue it from the Church; and it is euery where one ſelfe-ſame body, and not many; ſo as there is no profitable Sacrament of this precious meate, neither any Tree of Life in the aſſemblies of Heretikes, no more then in that of the Paynims; and if they carry it out of the Church with them, and take it, being Infidels, it is to their damnation, becauſe they are foorth of the holy Church, the true and onely earthly Paradiſe, in which is planted the Tree of Life for the children of God.<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>12.</hi> S.

               <head>2. THE ACCORD OF THE FIGVRE OF the Sacrifice of ABEL, with that of <hi>the Maſſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEhold now ſome draughts of this Figure, anſwering to the truth. The Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was the firſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Law of Nature: for albeit that <hi>Adam,</hi> no doubt, did Sacrifice; yet notwithſtanding the Scripture makes no mention thereof, but ſetteth downe this of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> as the firſt; and without doubt, this was alſo the firſt in dignity. In like manner, the firſt Sacrifice, offered by Ieſus Chriſt, true ABEL, is this of the Euchariſt, for that on the Croſſe was the ſecond. As <hi>Abel</hi> ſacrificed his firſt-borne Lambe; ſo Ieſus Chriſt offereth in the Euchariſt, the <hi>Firſt-borne</hi> of his Father, and of his Mother, and <hi>Firſt-borne amongst many brethren.</hi> As <hi>Abel,</hi> a little after he had ſacrificed, was led by his brother out of the houſe, and by him put to death. So our moſt happy Sauiour, after that he had offered his firſt Sacrifice, was made priſoner, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16409:24"/>the morrow after was led out of the Citie of Hieruſalem to Mount Caluary, and there crucified. The Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was pleaſing, by reaſon of the innocency and piety of the Offerer: the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt is alwayes pleaſing to God, by reaſon of his <hi>Beloned Sonne, in whom he is well pleaſed:</hi> for it is he which is alwayes the firſt and principall Offerer in the Maſſe, as he is alſo the principall agent in all the other Sacraments; for as it is he, which makes his Body; it is he alſo, that Baptiſeth; it is he that Confirmeth; it is he that Abſolueth vs from our ſinnes, and which doth all the reſt; the Prieſt being no more but his Vicar and Inſtrument therein: but the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt, in one thing, farre excelleth the other of ABEL, becauſe it is an Offering gratefull of it ſelfe to God, for it is Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe; it is he, which is the Offerer, and Offering together.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Sacrifice of ABEL containes alone three Sorts of Sacrifices, which after were inſtituted by God in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it ſhall be ſhewed in the Type of <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> which are the Holocauſt, the Hoſte Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and the Hoſte Propitiatory. In the firſt, all the Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was burnt, and offered directly to the honor of God, in acknowledgement of the homage, which wee owe to his diuine Maieſty. The ſecond was offered in giuing thankes, and in ſigne of a ioyfull vnion and alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Creator and the creature. The third was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. Theſe three ſorts were in the Sacrifice of ABEL, and are found clearely in the Sacrament of the Maſſe; for all is offered to God, and to his honor. In it, is a thankeſgiuing of the higheſt degree, by a Returne, as it were, made vnto him of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift, that euer he beſtowed, and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> by it we haue Propitiation, for finnes by it are pardoned. As for the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was truely an Holocauſt, and vertually a thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God, yet was it properly Propitiatory; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16409:25"/>therefore the Scripture aſſigning the cauſe, wherefore Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt died,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 25. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.</note> mentioneth alwayes ſinne; <hi>He was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>for our ſinnes,</hi> and often elſewhere; it is then Propitiatory. The Sacrifice of ABEL therefore containing the three fore-named ſorts of Sacrifices, was an expreſſe Figure of the Euchariſt, and ſo you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the truth hath accompliſhed the ancient Figure.</p>

Behold, he is arriued at the place, where he encounters <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, adorned with the attyre of a great King and chiefe Prieſt, full of Maieſty in his Perſon, and in his geſture. Behold his reuerend cariage, the ſweetneſſe of his countenance, and the grauity of his viſage; ſome haue thought that he was <hi>Sern, Noabs</hi> ſon; but the Scripture makes not any mention of his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no nor of his natiuity, and death, being otherwiſe accuſtomed to note very diligently the Genealogies, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Pedegrees of Illuſtrious perſons; which makes vs coniecture, that ſome high ſecret is hidden within the ſhadow of this myſticall ſilence, concerning his diſcent.</p>

He weares on his head an admirable Helmet, artificially grauen, enriched with gold, and adorned with a plume of many rare feathers. His Courtle-axe hangs on his left ſide, faſtened to a belt, after the manner of a skarfe. He kiſſeth his right hand in ſigne of Honor; with his left hand he holds his Leading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe: one of his Squires carrieth his Target; another holds his horſe by the bridle in the wing of the firſt Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron: this Horſe, as you ſee, is of a bright bay colour, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe vpon that foote, which is to the ſide of the Mounter, and lifting vp the other; and ſhewes by the faire faſhion of all his body, that he is well broken, and well mannaged, as worthy to be ridden by ſo great a Captaine. Behold a while his little head, his Rats eares pricking vp, his forehead leane and large, marked with a ſtarre right in the midſt, his necke of a reaſonable length, ſlender at the ſetting on of the head, big towards the breſt, and ſweetly bowing in the middle: the breſt round and large, and the crouper in proportion: the tayle and the mayne long; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

Thus being proud of their ſucceſſe, they went disbanded without order of warre, thinking of nothing but of drink and ſleeping. <hi>Abraham</hi> pierced to the heart with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of his Nephew, and his other Allyes, reſoluing to take reuenge, went with ſuch ſpeed after them, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16409:34"/>bread and the wine, into his body and bloud, and by the ſame action, hee offers it to his Father for his Church, though he vſe not any formall words of oblation, as by ſaying, <hi>I offer thee my body;</hi> for it is enough, that he make it preſent vpon the Altar with that intention; for he did no more in offering the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, as neither did the ancient Sacrificers in their Sacrifices. God vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſufficiently the language of the heart. The Church hauing this body from the liberality of God, offers it with Ieſus Chriſt, and by it doth honor him with homage of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſoueraigne whorſhip: ſhee alſo prayeth to him by the merits which were purchaſed in this body, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taketh it for her food and refection. And as in olde times God gaue beaſts to the Iewes, which the Iewes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him againe, honouring him in them, and did eate of the fleſh, to participate of the Sacrifice: ſo hath he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs the body of his Sonne, and we honor him with it, and pray vnto him, endeuoring by it, as by a rich preſent, to pacifie him, and to make him fauourable towards vs, and afterwards we take it for our refection; but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer conſuming the ſame, as the bodies of beaſts were conſumed, which could ſerue but once, and therefore to euery Sacrifice was required a new beaſt. But the body of our Sauiour is immortall, and alone ſufficient to honour God, and to be the food of immortalitie to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church,<note place="margin">S.

Euen ſo then in the Church, a ſpirituall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie; the Sacrament is ordained to helpe man, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to honour God: What more is done in the one or the other, it is rather by conſequence, then of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and therefore as a Sacrament is properly the ſigne, and inſtrument of the grace of God: ſo a Sacrifice eſpecially ſetteth foorth the greatneſſe and Maieſty of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a Sacrament profits onely him, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, being well diſpoſed and prepared, as Baptiſme ſanctifieth only the baptiſed: the Sacrifice may profit all the world, abſent, preſent, iuſt, iniuſt, diſpoſed, indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, liuing, and departed, if they be not in deadly ſinne; for though it be not directly inſtituted for the Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, as hath beene ſaid, yet notwithſtanding, it openeth the do ore to the ſanctification of all men, for as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16409:35"/>much as it pleaſeth God by honor and prayer, and by this office of piety it obtaines of him mercy and grace, and new bleſſings of repentance, and remiſſion of ſinnes to all thoſe, for whom it is offered. And ſo therefore the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe is profitable for all thoſe, which heare it, and for whom it is offered.</p>

               <p>AS the Church hath alwayes had Sacraments, for a meanes to ſanctifie the children of God; ſo it hath neuer been, nor euer ſhall be vpon the earth without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And ſure great reaſon there is it ſhould be ſo: for ſince that al true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is inſtituted for the ſoueraigne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement &amp; ſeruice of God; it is neceſſary that in his Church, which is his Kingdome and Monarchie, there ſhould be a publike worſhip of ſupreame honor, by which men aſſembled in one body, and ſocietie, might profeſſe their faith and dutie towards him. This worſhip is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, by which God is knowne and adored publikely, as our ſoueraigne Lord, Maſter of life and death: and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our good, the moſt high honor, that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, proper to God, and vncommunicable to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as onely due to diuine Maieſtie.

The Church then onely keeper of true Religion, hath euer had proper Sacrifice, and Prieſts appropriated by their office, to adminiſter the ſame. The moſt famous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Law of Nature, was that of bread and wine,

A Sacrifice moſt perfect, and moſt worthy of our Sauiour, who hath inſtituted it in the Law of Grace, the moſt perfect Monarchie that euer was, or which euer ſhall be, and inſtituted it after ſo noble a manner, as it is full of myſtery, to wit, after the reſemblance of the Sacrifice of the moſt noble King, and High-Prieſt, <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formes of bread and wine, which he ſhall offer, euen vntill the end of the world by his Prieſts and Vicars, he himſelfe remaining High-prieſt for euer, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>

And all this Moone, taking part of March and part of Aprill, makes the firſt month of the yeere, the ſecond Moone makes the ſecond month, and ſo of others; and ſo many new Moones, ſo many beginnings of new monethes; and the firſt day of the Moone, was the firſt of the month; and the fourteenth of the Moone, was the fourteenth of the moneth: So as the yeere of the Iewes, was twelue Moones, or twelue moneths of the Moone, euery one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nine and twenty daies and a halfe, which is the who'e ſpace of the courſe of the Moone; true it is, that to keepe the number of dayes whole, they make, that one moneth hath thirtie daies, and the other nine and twentie; and the monthly yeere containes but three hundred fifty and foure dayes, leſſe by eleuen dayes, then the yeare of the Sunne, which hath three hundred, threeſcore and fiue daies. For this cauſe, the Iewes from two yeeres to two, and from three to three, did enterlace one moneth; to the end to make by ſuch addition, their moonely yeare, equall to that of the Sunne, which other people vſe, as we doe now, and then their yeare conſiſted of thirteene months. Now the yeare, which begunne in this month of March, was the yeere commanded of God, and called holy or ſacred, for in it he ſet his people at liberty. The ordinance is ſet downe in theſe words:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ioſephus</hi> hath noted this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of yeares, amongſt many Authors, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vſe the ſame diſtinction, but grounded vpon another cauſe: for they haue a Sacred yeere, and a Ciuill; their Holy yeere begins either at Chriſtmas, or at the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, or in March. Before the time of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth in France, men began it at Eaſter, and ſince at the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and according to this yeere wee count at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, 1600. ſince the Natiuity of our Sauiour, comming into the world to repaire our ages, and to giue vs eternity for time.</p>
               <p>Our Ciuill yeare is variable, and according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of the Countrey, or condition of perſons; good husbands and Schollers begin at Saint <hi>Rhemigius,</hi> many at Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> ſome at Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and others at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeaſons: but the Holy yeare hath his vniforme limits, as it ought, and there is little difference through all the Catholike Church. Well then, God commanded the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes to keepe their yearely Sacrifice of the <hi>Paſchall Lambe,</hi> in this firſt month, and in the fourteenth day of it, becauſe this was the neareſt time to their going forth, and deliuerance; for they went forth the next morning, after the firſt-borne of the Aegyptians were ſlaine at midnight, the night before: So as the Ceremony was iuſtituted at that time preciſely, to put them in minde of the benefit, as alſo the day and houre of it; which was alwayes religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued, vntill the truth of this Figure at the ſame time, many yeares after was accompliſhed by our Sauiour, deliuering vs out of a greater ſeruitude, and ſubſtituting the true Lambe in memory thereof, as after we ſhall ſee. The ſame Hebrewes had commandement to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice euery new Moone, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Num. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; <hi>28.</hi> Ioſeph. lib. <hi>3.</hi> Antiq. cap. <hi>10.</hi>

This Feaſt was not inſtituted to ſerue as a Sacrifice to the new Moone, as the Pagans made it, but for a thankſgiuing to God for the benefits of his bounty and wiſdome, in the gouernment of the world; &amp; for to inſtruct vs, that we ought to make our entrie into all the ſeaſons; and to begin euery action with the praiſe of God, and inuocation of his holy name.

               <p>THe cauſes, wherefore God would, that the Hebrews ſhould take their years from the courſe of the Moone, rather then from the Sunne, as now the Church doth, are worthy to be knowne, if they were alſo eaſie to be found out. For it ought not to be doubted, but that this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was founded in great reaſon, comming from ſo wiſe a Law-maker. Amongſt many others, I finde three. The firſt is taken from the rudeneſſe of this people, to which God hauing regard, commaunded them to reckon their yeares and months by the Moone, as more facill and eaſie, then if they accounted by the twelue celeſtiall ſignes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed by the Chaldeans, and other Heatheniſh people. For euery one ſeeth the new Moone, and all his quarters; and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16409:47"/>the moſt ſimple can obſerue, that ſhee ends her whole courſe within one moneth; whereas none knowes the ſignes of the Zodiaque, but Aſtronomers.<note place="margin">S. Greg. Naz. Or. <hi>2.</hi> de Paſch.</note> The ſecond is more important, touched by Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> that it was, to keepe in order by this ceremony the Iewes from following the ſuperſtition of the Pagans, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely giuen to the worſhip of the Moone; for they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored it in heauen, as a Queene: in the earth, and vnder earth, as a Goddeſſe, vnder the name of <hi>Luna, Diana, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpina;</hi> whoſe example might giue occaſion to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vainely giuen, and of themſelues inclined to imitate the fooliſh Pagans, to ſuffer themſelues to be head-long carried to Idolatry, ſo much in practiſe in thoſe dayes, if they had not ſome true and lawfull vſe of the Moone, thereby to be held from the abuſe therof, againſt the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Therfore God commanded them, to order their months and yeares, Feaſtes and Ceremonies, according to the courſe of the Moone; adored the true God in his Law, and ſeruing themſelues of the creature, to the honour of their Creator.<note place="margin">Exod. 25.</note> And with like wiſdome hee ordained the Arke of Couenant, to the end they ſhould haue ſome viſible thing, before which to honor God, without running to Idols. The third cauſe is full of myſtery, and it was to giue a ſecret and myſticall ſignification of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Synagogue, by the qualities of the Moone, very ſignificant of it. The Moone is the loweſt Planet of all, terreſtriall and groſſe, and yet celeſtiall notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: the Iudaicall Law alſo was earthly and carnall, the Ceremonies, Sacrifices, Promiſes, and the reſt, no better, and yet giuen of God notwithſtanding; and therefore celeſtiall in this reſpect; the Moone is a cold and mutable Planet: the Synagogue a Law of feare, which is a cold paſſion, a temporall Law, and mutable, which was to be changed into the Law of Grace. The Moone by her light doth not ripen any fruit; though ſhee giue by her influence

For theſe reaſons amongſt others, the Lunary yeare was the yeare, and the time of the Synagogue.

               <p>Saint <hi>Iuſtin</hi> ſingularly remarketh,<note place="margin">S. iuſtin. Dialo. cont. Trypho.</note> that the Lamb was ſo diſpoſed of, when they roſted it, that it made the Figure of a Croſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe-ſame Lambe, in other ceremonies, was one of the moſt rare Figures of the Euchariſt; as our Sauiour declareth in generall, when after the eating of the Lambe, he inſtituted incontinently the Sacrifice of his body. For he ioyned not with any other intention theſe two ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,<note place="margin">S. Cyprian. ſerm. de Can.

Firſt, the Law commandeth to offer the Lambe in the euening of the fourteenth day of the firſt Moone, that is to ſay, of the firſt month of the yeare, as hath been ſaid, and afterwards to eate it: for it could not be eaten, without it were firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated, as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Niſſe,</hi> noteth.<note place="margin">S.

               <p>Now this accompliſhment hath not been made in the Sacrifice of the Croſſe; for this Sacrifice fell not out in the fourteenth, but in the fifteenth day of the Moone, which was the Friday following, neither in the euening of the day, but at midday, when our Sauiour, mounting on the Croſſe, hung thereon three hourſes after, before he died; neither was there then any myſticall refection; for none did eate at that time, neither was this Sacrifice made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately

How can it be, that he ſhould now be immolated, ſeeing that he is immortall. The Catholike Doctors anſwere to this queſtion, that if one take the word of immolation ſtrictly, and in rigour, ſignifying reall occaſion, it was not properly done, but on the Croſſe, and heere is no immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that nature, for ſo much as the body of our Sauiour is now remoued infinitely from the gripes of death, and from all hurt, not onely on the Altar, but whereſoeuer elſe he is.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>6.</hi>

               <p>THere is yet one noble conſideration more in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe, which ſhewes the vſe and the end, for which our Sacrifice was ordained. The Paſchall Lambe was inſtituted in ſigne of the deliuery of the Iewes,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.14.26.</note> Wherefore this was a ſigne of the benefit to be receiued, and a memoriall thereof, after it was receiued. The reſemblance of this Figure hath been perfectly accompliſhed in the verity. For our Sauiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16409:51"/>the Sacrament and Sacrifice of his body vpon the euening, of that night, in which he was taken, to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the next morning, and paſſe from this world into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; to ſtiſle by his death the true firſt-borne of Aegypt, to wit, the ſinnes of mankinde, and to bury afterwards in his precious bloud, as within the depth of a red-Sea of his infinite merits, the powers of hell for the true deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Elect.</p>
               <p>This Sacrifice then was a ſigne of the victory, which was to be gotten, and a memoriall of the ſame, after it was gained; this our Sauiour ſignified, when inſtituting the ſame, he foretold the Apoſtles of his death, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to doe what hee had done, in remembrance of him, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">

For as the night which followed the inſtitution of the Paſchall Lambe, was the great Vigil, and immediate ſigne of the deliuerance of the Hebrewes; ſo alſo the midnight of our Sauiour, which followed the inſtitution of this Sacrifice, was the great brunt, and the immediate enſigne of our redemption. The time of this midnight was at ful midday, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted on the Croſſe to encounter the enemy, and to ouerthrow our ſins with out-ſtretched armes; this was a profound midnight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of ſpirituall darkneſſe, in which they were buried, which procured his death; a midnight alſo of corporall darkneſſe; for the Sunne and the Moone, enraged with the indignity of ſuch a crime, committed againſt the perſon of their Creator, were ſuddenly colypſed, and cauſed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found darkneſſe extraordinary, and a dreadfull night in the midſt of the day. And as the Ceremony of the Paſchall Lambe, continued in memory of the good, receiued in Aegypt, ſo long as the Synagogue endured. So in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Sacrifice of the Maſſe was inſtituted, to continue in memory of the victorious Paſſion of our Lord, ſo long as the Church ſhall be militant heere on earth: and this is it

               <p>THere were a great number of Myſticall Ceremonies, vſed in eating of the Iewes Paſchall Lambe, which in their ſhadowes Figure to vs the truth of ours, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtruct vs how we ought to eate it, for to draw ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life from it. The Iewes Lambe was offered in the euening: Ieſus Chriſt gaue himſelfe in the Euchariſt, and on the Croſſe, in the euening of the world, and at the <hi>last howre of the day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2.18.</note> as ſpeaketh the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> The Lambe was to be roaſted, thereby to ſhew the burning charitie of our Sauiour, in giuing his body in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeaſoned and coloured with the flame of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning charity; teaching vs withall, that wee muſt bring with vs feruent loue, when we come to eate it; for this is the preparation, and the appetite, with which ſpirituall meates ought to be taken, for the good nouriſhment of our ſoules.<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> Thoſe, which did eate it, ought to be Iewes by bloud, or by Religion; no perſon may eate our Lamb, that is not a Chriſtian, borne of Chriſtians, or made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by Baptiſme. They did eate it in the night, to ſhew that our Euchariſt is a hidden myſtery, and inuiſible to ſenſe and humane iudgement, and knowne onely to faith. The Father of euery Family was to eate it; euery Paſtor in his Pariſh, as in his Family; and euery Church as a Family vnder her Paſtor, eates the Lambe of God; but with this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16409:52"/>difference, that the Iewes did eate diuers Lambes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers houſes, and in diuers times, their Lambe being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible: the Chriſtians eate all one ſelfe-ſame Lambe, in all times, Ieſus Chriſt incorruptible Lambe and immortal, and onely ſufficient for all, and alwayes. They did not breake the bones, to Figure the impaſſibility of the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our Lambe Ieſus Chriſt, hid vnder the Humanity, as the bones are hidden vnder the fleſh: and further, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the impaſſibilitie of his body, hid vnder the formes of bread and wine. And therefore the Figure is perfectly accompliſhed in our Banquet; for we eate our Lambe, not onely without breaking his bones, but without hurting whatſoeuer of his fleſh, all whole, all vnited, all immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, without euer conſuming of it.</p>
               <p>The Figure giues but a little touch concerning the bone onely, the verity goes further, and accompliſheth it alſo in the body. They were to eate it haſtily, to ſhew that this myſtery ought to be deuoured with a liuely and bleſſed faith, without the narrow ſifting curioſity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and humane ſenſe. Of the ſelfe-ſame ſignification was the Ceremony which commanded to burne what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; to teach vs, what we cannot comprehend in our myſtery, that we ought to burne in the fire of Charity. The bread without leauen, ſignifies the ſinceritie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that men ought to bring to this Table,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> interprets it: the bitter Lettice ſignifies Penance; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence it is, that the children of the Church of God, before they preſent themſelues to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament; put their ſoules in good eſtate, bewailing their ſins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelues, and doing penance for them. The Iews were gyrt eating their Lambe; in ſigne that we ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things to be chaſt, when we eate of this virginall fleſh of the Lambe without ſpor. For Luxury proceedeth from the Reines; and to girde the Reines, is to take away the firſt cauſes of the ſinne of the fleſh, and make whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to dye in its ſpring; and therefore Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:16409:53"/>ſaith,<note place="margin">S. Greg hom. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We then put the girdle to our reines, when we repreſſe the laſciuiouſneſſe of the fleſh, by the bridle of continency.</hi> The ſtaffe in their hands, and ſhooes of dead skinne on their feete, after the faſhion of people, which are to take a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, teach vs, that we ſhould liue in this mortall fleſh, as pilgrimes dead to this world, hauing for the ſoueraigne ſtrength of our Pilgrimage, the ſtaffe of the Croſſe †; and for our ſhooes of our feet, the meditation of death; and this at euery pace and moment of our life, as indeed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſteppe we approach to the graue. There are then in all theſe faire lineaments and myſteries figured and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, ſufficient markes whereby to acknowledge, as well the truth, which is the Sacrament of our Lambe, the Redeemer, as alſo the bounty and ſupreame wiſdome, of him who hath figured it by his ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by his owne proper hand fulfilled the ſame.</p>
               <p>But who ſhall giue vs eyes to penetrate ſufficiently theſe workes? words to praiſe them highly? affection to loue them holily? except thou, O ſoueraigne Maſter, who art the worker of them? Who ſhall make vs touch the fruit of thy fleſh, and of thy bloud, except thou, which giueſt them vs to vſe? Who ſhall deliuer vs from <hi>Pharoe,</hi> and from Aegypt, except thou, that haſt certainly deliuered vs? But we vnthankfull and forgetfull wretches, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againe the iron chaine of ſeruitude, by our ſinnes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>
               <p>O ſweet Lamb, that didſt come into this world, to wipe away the ſins of the world, in the purple colour of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bloud, imployed to dye red the poaſts of the Croſſe, and to turne from vs the violence of the deſtroying Angel.

It continued in this manner forty yeeres and no more; and this was one of the miracles, that this people ſaw there continually in the Deſert; this was then a celeſtiall food ſupernaturall and diuine. This quality agrees very well to our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For, firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the body of our Sauiour was not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after a naturall manner,<note place="margin">Luke <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> but by vertue of the holy Ghoſt, in the wombe of the Virgin, which are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cauſes. Secondly, this body is made preſent,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the Altar, vnder the formes of bread and wine, by the miniſtery of Prieſts, which are the Angels of God in the Church. Theſe are thoſe, which, as inſtruments, make this body in the Sacrament, vſing to that end the omnipotent word of Ieſus Chriſt, THIS IS MY BODY, and in this ſenſe it is made by Angells, and is the true bread of Angels. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Manna was giuen for prouiſion in the Deſert of Arabia, euen vntill they entred into the Land of Promiſe: the Sacrament is giuen vs in the Deſert of this world, vntill the Church militant ſhall enter victoriouſly, and triumphantly into the Land of the liuing, which is her heauenly countrey. Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Manna gathered in little or great quantity, was neither more nor leſſe; for neuer a one had in the end more then the meaſure of a <hi>Gomer,</hi> bee it that he had gathered more or leſſe, and this meaſure was equally ſufficient to euery one, nouriſhing a man growne, and not ouer-charging the ſtomack of a yong childe. A
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16409:57"/>thing in truth moſt admirable; that in a multitude of more then ſix hundred thouſand of people, and ſo great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of complexions, and of ſtemackes, the ſelfe-ſame quantity was equall and proportionable to the condition of euery one. This alſo is more admirably ſeene in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; for it is not greater in a little Hoaſt, then in a great one, in a piece, then in all; and the body of our Sauiour is all in all the Hoaſt, and all in euery part of it; and is giuen equally to all, vnder vnequall pieces; how be it, that in regard of the effect, it profits more to thoſe that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Fiftly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Manna ſerued both for meat and drinke; for it baked into bread before the fire, and ranne into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Sunne, here-hence is that the Doctors ſaid, that the Iewes asking water, murmured malitiouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe;<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> for ſo much as hauing Manna, they had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to eate and drinke; neither more nor loſſe, then long time after them the fiue thouſand, which did cate in the Deſert the bread and fiſhes multiplied, had both meat and drinke by that miraculous food, in Figure of our Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Euen ſo the Euchariſt it ſelfe giueth the body and the bloud of our Sauiour, true bread and true drinke together, though it be but vnder one kinde.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, Manna was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and hidden betweene two dewes;<note place="margin">Gloſſa ex Rab.

                  </note> the body and bloud of our Sauiour is couered and hid from our ſenſe and iudgement, vnder the outward accidents of bread and wine.

The Scripture, which puts not one tittle to paper without reaſon, compares Manna to Coriander, to the end (no doubt) wee ſhould marke a wonder, hidden in the Iudaicall ſhadowes, to be diſcouered in the light of our faith; the which wonder conſiſts in this, that one part alone of our Sacrament hath life, as well as the the whole; and that euery peece of an Hoaſt broken, containes as much as the whole Hoaſt. This wonder was ſignified (as I ſaid before) in the quantity of Manna, which was ſo equall in the prouiſion, although it were gathered in vnequall meaſure. Then the Scripture ſaying that Manna, the olde Figure, was like to the graine of Coriander, gaue an outward Picture to the Iewes, and ſignified to vs the inward life of our Manna, in all his parts, hauing the likeneſſe of Coriander; albeit this be in one reſpect infinitely more perfect, for none of the parts of Coriander, is all the Coriander; but all the parts of the Sacrament, are all the Sacrament, and all containe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord, and all are the whole: yet if we reſpect the formes, the parts of the Hoaſt are not the whole Hoaſt, but only a part thereof.</p>

Heere he ſaith, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and his body is found there, <hi>This is my bloud,</hi> and his bloud is there preſent. Then his omnipotent Word made that to be, which was not before at all: now it makes preſent his body in a place, where it was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before. There it changed nothing into the creature: heere it changeth one creature into another, and in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner into the Creator himſelfe; ſo as the Prieſtes working in the Conſecration by vertue of this omnipotent words, are in this reſpect Creators of their Creator. For changing the bread into the body of our Sauiour, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this body preſent, they make alſo by neceſſary conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance, that his Soule and his Diuinity, which neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandons the body, be alſo preſent; and by ſuch operation they produce after a certaine manner the diuine Perſon, and their Creator, neither more nor leſſe, then the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Therefore the myſtery of the Incarnation, as alſo of Tranſubſtantiation, is greater and nobler, then that of Creation. For the effect of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a creature, to wit, the World; but the effect of the Incarnation, as alſo of Tranſubſtantiation, is the Creator, by reaſon of this conſequence and concomitance.

God then ſheweth himſelfe greater in this change, then he did in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore after the Creation, and before the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Tranſubſtantiation, when he would giue proofe of his power, it was firſt by the change of one creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, becauſe ſuch an operation did moſt properly teſtifie the ſoueraigne Maſter of Nature; but therewithall to facilitate the faith of Tranſubſtantiation, which he was to make in the Law of Grace, of bread and wine into the body and bloud of his Sonne.

So God is all, through all, and all in euery part of the world, and our ſoule through all the body, and all in euery part. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Sauiour is not euery where, that being a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue reſerued to the Diuinitie alone; but it is in many places in one ſelfe-ſame time, and in all parts of the Hoaſt; which is naturall to ſpirits, and a priuiledge giuen to this body, vnited to the Diuinitie. And ſince God giueth the power to Angells, which are ſpirits, to take a corporall being, and to cloath themſelues with ſome humaine, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible forme, and to poſſeſſe a place after the manner of a body, it is not to be doubted, but he can giue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe to a body, eſpecially his deified body, the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to be in this Sacrament, after the manner of a ſpirit, without poſſeſſing any place; and it repugnes no more to the nature of a body, not to poſſeſſe a place, then to the fier not to burne; wherefore, as the fier ceaſed not to bee fier within the furnace,<note place="margin">Van. <hi>3.</hi>

The Scripture makes to vs eaſie the faith of this miracle, teaching that our Sauiour went forth of the Sepulcher, it being ſhut; and that he entred into the chamber of the Apoſtles, the doores being ſhut, his body then poſſeſſed no place at that time, or two bodies were in one ſelfe-ſame place with penetration of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is an effect as difficult, and hard to Nature, and onely depending of the omnipotencie of God.</p>

This was, becauſe in that firſt eſtate, he had his ſoule cloathed with all kinde of goodly garments, of Iuſtice, of Chaſtity, of Charity, of Fortitude, of Temperance, and of other ſuch like attire, and had nothing vpon his body, neither had he need.

                  <hi>Ezech,</hi> 40.41.</note> is this incloſure of walles, hauing fiue hundred cubits in ſquare: but to ſpeake properly, it is that Houſe built with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the encloſure towards the Weſt end, magnificently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered; in height twenty cubits, and fixtie in length, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts: the firſt of which is twenty cubits long, and is the moſt holy part; for this is the Holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, place for the Arke of Couenant, where no perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſauing onely the High-Prieſt, and that but once in the yeere.

On this Altar euery Prince of the Prieſts, in the circuit of his office, offers Incenſe to God, euening and morning; as <hi>Zachary</hi> did,<note place="margin">Zachary. Luke <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> the father of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> The reſt of the incloſure is without roofe, diuided into two great Yards or Courts, each one being an hundred cubits in length and largeneſſe. On the South ſide and North ſide, were certaine houſes, called <hi>Gazophilaces,</hi> as much to ſay, as treaſuries. They were for the habitations of Prieſts and Leuites, and to keepe the holy treaſures; hauing neere vnto them certaine walking-places,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16409:83"/>and little walls. The firſt Court, ſeparated from the ſecond by a little wall, hauing a portall in the midſt, is the place, where the Prieſt, make their Sacrifices vpon this great Alzar, which is night againſt the Temple. Where you ſee fiue Ceſterns on the right hand, and fiue on the left, full of water, to waſh the entrals and feete of the Victimes. And on the left ſide of the wall of ſeparation, neere to the Portall, a molten Ceſterne, called a Sea, by reaſon of the exceeding great capacity thereof; for it is ten cubits ſquare, and fiue cubit; deepe; and this is the ſountaine wherein the Prieſts waſhed their hands and feer, when they went to offer Sacrifice. The ſecond Court is the place for Lay-people; and this little raiſed vp ſeat, in the forme of a ſeaffold, in the midſt of it, is a Throne of braſſe, fiue cubits ſquare,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 9.13.</note> and three cubits high, where <hi>Salomon,</hi> and the Kings of the Iewes after him were placed, during the time of the Sacrifice. Now this great multitude of men, which are in the firſt Court, are the Prieſts and Leuites; and the other in the other Court, are the people, all there aſſembled for the ſolemnity of the new Oblation of the firſt fruits in Harueſt, called the Feaſt of Pentecoſt. In which Oblation, after many bloudy Sacrifices, to wit, of ſeuen Lambes, two ſheepe, one Oxe, offered in Holocauſt; and one Goate offered for ſinne; two Wheat-loaues, with two Lambes, were offered to God as Peace-offerings, that is to ſay, in action of thankes; euery one hauing made an Oblation of his firſt fruits, to the Prieſts, according to the Law.

For that the Altar was raiſed vp ten cubits high, and the walles, which ſeperated the Court,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 41.</note> were but three cubits high; they eaſily heare the voices of the Prieſts, and of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall Inſtruments,<note place="margin">Ioſeph lib. <hi>5.</hi> de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Herehence it is, that the Scripture ſaith, that they eate the ſinnes of the people, that is to ſay, the Sacrifices offered for the ſinnes of the people.

               <p>THe Loaues of the Firſt-fruits, were made of the fineſt flower of Wheate, and round, after the manner of a cake. We haue heere the matter and forme of our Hoaſts: The Prieſt did lift it vp before the people, in Figure of the eleuation of our Sauiour vpon the Croſſe. The Prieſt alſo eleuates the conſecrated Hoaſt, that it may be adored, and maketh ouer it many ſignes of the Croſſe. The Sacrifice of Loaues were <hi>Min-ha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malac. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> that is to ſay, not bloudy; the Maſſe is a Sacrifice of the ſame kinde, without effuſion of bloud, and the true Oblation <hi>Minha,</hi> foretold by <hi>Malachy.</hi> The Figure was called in the Law a new Sacrifice: which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> names in the Hebrew and Syriach tongue,<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Miſſa,</hi> that is to ſay, Oblation rich, and ſufficient; which word is not found in all the Bible to ſignifie any other thing, but this new Oblation, as the Hebrew Doctors teach. All this is liuely agreeable to the Maſſe: for in regard firſt of the name, it is agreeable to it in euery point; ſeeing that this our Sacrifice is ſingularly a new Sacrifice in all reſpects, in reſpect of the thing offered, of the Prieſt, and of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of offering it. The thing offered is ſingularly new; it is a new fruit, brought forth from a new earth, to wit, the body of our Sauiour borne of the Virgin, a new bread, a liuing bread, immortall and glorious. The Prieſt alſo new, to wit, the Sonne of God, the annointed of God, King of men and Angels, and there was neuer the like, nor neuer ſhall be hereafter. The manner wholly new, for the thing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16409:86"/>offered, and the Prieſt is the ſelfe-ſame thing, and both the one and the other, are hidden vnder the formes of bread and wine, all in the one, and all in the other kinde, and all in euery part of it, in his proper quantity, in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and in his glory, though our ſenſe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſee nothing, but the outward ſignes. So is this Sacrifice altogether new, and not knowne either in the Law of Nature, or in the Law of <hi>Moyſes.</hi>

The which is probable, becauſe it is ſo called by many ancient Fathers both Greeke and Latine; as S. <hi>Clement,</hi> Succeſſor of Saint <hi>Peter; Abdias,</hi> who wrote the life of the Apoſtles, either in Greeke or in Hebrew. S. <hi>Euariſtus</hi> Pope, who ſate the yeere 97. S. <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſitting in the yeere 106. <hi>Teleſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ſitting in the yeare 127. S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Leo.</hi> Moreouer, the firſt Romane Councell, the ſecond of Carthage, the Councell of Agath. and many other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors of the firſt foure Ages, and all theſe haue often vſed it, as a name frequented among the Chriſtians, which is an argument that it was left by tradition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, howſoeuer the Church did vſe in the beginning many
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16409:87"/>other names, eſpecially the Greeke Church. Some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors haue thought it to be a Latine word, for the likeneſſe of the ſyllables, and of the ſound. But the argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not that it is rather Latine, then Hebrew, ſeeing that it hath the like ſyllables, and ſound in both Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and if the Latine challenge it by that title, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew may challenge it by the ſame. And after this manner euery one may draw to his Language a thouſand ſtrange words by ſimilitude or likeneſſe, and may put themſelues in danger to incurre the crime of vnluſt vſurpers, or ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, as it happened to <hi>Optatus</hi> in the word <hi>Cephas,</hi> which he thought to be Greeke, by reaſon of the likeneſſe of ſyllables of the word <hi>Cephale,</hi> Head. By like miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing, the Latins may alſo ſay, that the Hebrew words <hi>Alma, Maſſa, Cera,</hi> and ſuch like, are onely Latin, becauſe they haue a Latine ſound, and euery Language may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the word <hi>Sac</hi> as her owne, becauſe it hath the ſame ſound and ſignification in all tongues. It is then as likely, that the word <hi>Miſſa,</hi> is an Hebrew word, as that it is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. But if any ſhall reſolutely hold, that it comes rather from the Latine, then from the Hebrew I ſhall more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly agree thereunto. For this caſuall encounter of the Latine with the Hebrew, is more meruailous, then if it had been deriued from the Hebrew. For it could not happen; but by diuine prouidence, that one Latine word ſhould be ſo happily tyed, and allyed to the Hebrew, that it ſeemes altogether to be an Hebrew word, and that the Hebrew word ſhould come ſo neere to the Latine, that it ſeemes indeed to be a Latine word, and that this word hath been vſed to ſignifie the like thing in diuers Languages, and Lawes. The Hebrew word in the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Figure of the Sacrifice of our Sauiours body: and the Latine word, to ſignifie in Latine the truth of the ſame Sacrifice in the Law of Grace.

               <head>TRANSVBSTANTIATION MADE IN the Sacrament, figured by the Leauen.</head>
               <p>THere are yet more myſticall draughts in the ancient Figure, which preach into vs the truth of our Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; but principally three: The firſt the Leauen: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Time: the third the Sacrifices, foregoing this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It hath been ſaid, that theſe Loaues were made of Leauen-paſte, and were eleuated in Oblation, by the High Prieſt, with the Lambes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>the Sacrificers ſhall-eleuate the Lambes, with the Loaues of the Firſt-fruits, turning them before the Lord.</hi> In ſuch ſort, as the Loaues were put aboue the Lambes, and all was eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together. This is a diuine draught of Gods Penſell, in the Table of the Figure; teaching vs not only the preſence of the body of his Sonne, true Lambe, without blot in the Sacrifice of the Maſſe; but alſo the manner of his being there, which is by tranſubſtantiation, that is to ſay, by changing of the ſubſtance of bread, into the ſubſtance of the body of our Sauiour, hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the formes of bread. The Leauen heretofore hath been a ſigne vnto vs of ſome bad thing; but heere, by a contrary quality it is a ſigne of that, which is good: as often in Scripture one ſelfe-ſame thing hath ſundry and contrary ſignifications, by reaſon of contrary references and reſpects. So the Lion,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>49 9.</hi> Apoc. <hi>5.5. 1.</hi> Pet. <hi>5.8.</hi>
                  </note> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as a Royall and ſtrong beaſt, is a ſigne of God; as he is cruell and fierce, a ſigne of the Diuell. For which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16409:88"/>cauſe our Sauiour himſelfe expreſſeth Vice by Leauen in one place;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.21.</note> and in another he compares his Church to Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The Leauen then in the Loaues of the Firſt-fruits, figureth to vs, the tranſubſtantiation, which is made in our Euchariſt, as already often hath been ſaid, and muſt bee ſaid hereafter, behold the picture. The Leauen by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall property changeth the paſte, heates it, puffes it vp, and giues it in a certaine manner, ſoule and life, ſo farre forth as it is capable thereof. The word of God, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Leauen, changeth alſo the bread, and becauſe it is of more force, then nature, it paſſeth alſo further; for it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth not the qualities, as the natural leaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the paſte, but the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; it leaues the viſible qualities, &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth the bread within; it animateth truly this bread, &amp; makes it liuing bread, changing the ſubſtance of it into the fleſh of the Lambe of God, Ieſus Chriſt, ſignified by the Lambes, offred with the Loaues in this Sacrifice. The Loaues, &amp; the Lambes, eleuated by the High Prieſt, were diuers things, and did make one onely oblation; heere, where the truth is liuely accompliſhed, diuers elements alſo make one ſelf-ſame Oblation; for the Lambe is vnder the formes of bread and wine; and when thoſe elements are multiplied, and offered in diuers places, it is alwayes one ſelfe-ſame Lambe, and one ſelfe-ſame Sacrifice. So as this draught, drawne in the old Figure, tells vs that the Sacrifice, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the bread of Firſt-fruits, ſhould be one Sacrifice of fleſh, vnder the ſhewes of bread and wine; to which draught our Sauiour gaue liuely colours, when he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sacrament of his body vnder theſe elements. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it without myſtery, that the Loaues and the Lambs were of two diuers natures, for they ſignified two natures in one Ieſus Chriſt, the Diuinity, and the Humanity; two things in one Sacrament, the earthly, which are the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents, and the heauenly, which is the body of the Sonne of God, and his Grace. Finally, they ſignified two peoples, the Gentiles and Iewes, vnited vnder one Head,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16409:88"/>reduced into one, and made one by meanes of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sacrifice. And ſo his diuine Wiſdome not only teacheth vs, by this figuratiue Lineament, the preſence of his Fleſh in the Euchariſt, but alſo the quality of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after what manner he makes vs his fleſh, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs therein. Let vs ſee what the Scripture, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hebrew, and Chriſtian Doctors ſay hereof, enriching the Figure with the embroderies of their learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

The ſame faith and doctrine ſaith, that it remaines there with a diuine Preſence ſpirituall, and ſupernaturall, in its quantity, without poſſeſſing any place, and in its Maieſty, without any ſhew thereof, being there immortall and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but inuiſible to ſenſe, and incomprehenſible to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and humane iudgement, as hath been ſaid elſewhere.

The Hebrewes (as we haue ſaid before in the Table of Propoſition Loaues) haue taught, that theſe Loaues were called <hi>Breads of faces,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did Figure forth a Sacrifice, in the which there ſhould be bread in the beginning, and fleſh in the end; for the ſubſtance of bread was there to be changed into the ſubſtance of the body of the Meſſias, the outward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents remaining whole; and that it ſhould be a Sacrifice of two faces; one outward of bread, which the ſenſe might ſee; and the other inward, of the ſubſtance of fleſh, which Faith only could perceiue.

               <p>THe Chriſtians haue been ſo much more reſolute, and cleare in ſetting downe the Faith and Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and the manner of the preſence of our Sauiours body in this Sacrament, by how much they haue had better Maſters, then the ancient Hebrews. Their Maſters were our Sauiour himſelfe, the Sonne of Truth, the Reuealer of heauenly ſecrets, and his Apoſtles filled with the new light of the Holy Ghoſt: whereas the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes had none, but <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Prophets, which taught by ſhadowes and Figures. Behold then what they haue ſaid of this admirable change, which wee call Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and of the manner how the body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour remaines in the Sacrament.</p>

For firſt we vnderſtand hereby, that the body of our Sauiour is made preſent in the Sacrament by Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, that is to ſay, by change of ſubſtance, the ſubſtance of bread giuing place to the ſubſtance of his body, which ſucceeds by vertue of his Omnipotent word. And becauſe the Soule, and the Diuinity neuer leaue this body, whole Ieſus Chriſt is in the Sacrament, his body by vertue of his Word; his Soule and his Diuinity, as neceſſarily following, and accompanying the ſame. Secondly, we learne, that ſo long as the ſpecies be there vncorrupted, the ſame body remaines vnder them with its quantity, beauty, immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and glory, but ſupernaturally and in a ſpirituall and diuine manner, without being perceiued, vnleſſe by the eyes of faith, as we haue before declared, ſo far forth, as a thing ineffable can be declared. By meanes whereof, the Fathers often aduertiſe vs, not to conſult heere with the Lawes of Nature, nor to regard, what ſenſe and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane iudgement tells vs, but ſimply to beleeue the word of him, who can doe all, and cannot lye.</p>

               <p>HEere it ſhall be good to note, wherefore our Sauiour gaue his body, veiled vnder the ſhewes of bread and wine, &amp; not viſible, &amp; in proper forme. For hereby we ſhal come to know, that he was noleſſe wiſe, then he is good; not onely giuing vs an ineſtimable gift, but alſo giuing it after the manner he did. The principall reaſons noted by the Fathers, are theſe; The firſt is taken from the nature of the Sacrament: for ſince that euery Sacrament is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne of an inuiſible thing; it followeth, that he giuing his body in this Sacrament, was to couer it vnder ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes, as the accidents are, the colour, the whiteneſſe, the ſauour, and ſuch like things, which obiected to our ſenſe, might put our ſoule in minde of ſome ſecret thing; whereas if he had giuen it openly, it had not been a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full of myſtery, but a ſimple gift of his body.</p>

And it was eaſie to ſee, how his skinne felt this fier, when it was cruelly torne with whips, as alſo his head, crowned with thornes, and his ſacred viſage, defiled with ſpittle. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none of thoſe, which ſacrificed, did eate of this Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice, no man alſo did eate of this: And they, that did burne the fleſh of the ancient Victime, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and were to purifie themſelues in the water of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, before they came againe into the City: They alſo, which did put our Sauiour to death, became thereby abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16409:103"/>in the ſight of God; and if they would enter into the City of Hieruſalem, which is his Church, they were firſt to be purified by the water of Baptiſme. Behold from point to point, and tittle to tittle, the Figure accompliſhed in the Sacrifice of the Croſſe, which hath truely wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our ſinnes, and giueth abeundant grace of peace and Propitiation, ſo it be applied, as God hath ordained, that is, by the Sacraments; but aboue all, by the Sacrament and Sacrifice of the Euchariſt.</p>

The bloud is ſet vpon the Altar, and offered to God in the Maſſe. The fleſh of the body of our Sauiour likewiſe is there eaten, both by Prieſts and Lay people; who in quality of Chriſtians, and faithfull people, are all, in ſome ſort, accounted Prieſts, and Kings, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls them:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</note> And for ſo much as they prepare

               <p>BVT if the Sacrifice of the Croſſe bee our whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the infinite price, paid for all our ſins, and of a thouſand ſinfull worlds, if there had been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; how ſay we, that the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and good workes are propitiatory? I anſwere, that the Sacrifice of the Croſſe is the Fountaine head of our ſaluation; the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and Sacraments are the Riuers by which the merits of the Croſſe flow into our ſoules, and without which, this merit ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull to vs. Baptiſme is one of theſe Riuers, ſo is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirmation, and the other Sacraments. The Sacrifice of the Maſſe is one of them alſo; and by them the Croſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth ſaluation, but to no other, ſauing only to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: For Turkes and Pagans doe not receiue any fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not any Sacrament, nor Sacrifice, by which they may open the doore to come to this Merit, and make flow into them the waters of Redemption, and of health. The Croſſe to them is a Fountaine ſtopped, an Orchard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, a Treaſure locked vp; becauſe they neither haue the Conduit-pipe, nor the entry, nor the Key, by which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16409:106"/>they may be partakers thereof. The Maſſe therefore is no more a new redemption, then the Sacraments, as that of the Croſſe was; but an excellent meanes to apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which was made on the Croſſe. The Sacraments are meanes in their kinde. The Euchariſt hath the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Good workes are good and Propitiatory, not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but becauſe they are founded vpon the Croſſe; and without this ſtay, they are vnprofitable to eternall life. Wherefore, the Sacraments, the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, good workes, godly actions, and all Chriſtian Religion, take life, force and vertue from the Croſſe. The Sacraments are the Conduit-pipes; the good workes, the fruites; the Euchariſt is the great Key. The Sacraments profit, and are Propitiatory onely to thoſe, which receiue them in good diſpoſition; Baptiſme remits ſinne onely, to him, that is baptized; Penance to him, which doth it; and ſo of the reſt. The Euchariſt, as a Sacrament, giueth grace onely to him, which communicates, but as a Sacrifice it profits all thoſe, for whom it is offered: as well for that it is a moſt noble action, made with a generall and moſt effectuall Prayer; as alſo by reaſon of the preſent it makes to God; and is therefore a generall meanes to appeaſe him, by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him the body of his Sonne, who hath paid all, and for all, and therefore is able to obtaine all. Wherefore, if Maſſe bee ſaid for the Iuſt, it procures them encreaſe of grace, and vertue to perſeuer therein; if for repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it obtaines them pardon; if for the impenitent, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them repentance; if for Infidels, it obtaineth their conuerſion; and ſo it profits all the liuing. If it be applied to the Saints departed, it honors them; if for thoſe which are in Purgatory it diminiſheth their paines. But what if you obiect? Maſſe is offred for many, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remaine obſtinate in their wickedneſſe? I grant they doe, but it is by their owne fault, who depriue themſelues of this fruit; for it profits others. The Croſſe is a wayes

               <p>AS the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and all the Sacraments of the Church, doe take their vertue from the infinit merit of the Croſſe; ſo they honor it, by applying the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof. For ſo many times as they giue grace, ſo often they giue occaſion to praiſe the firſt cauſe of that grace. Neither more nor leſſe, then naturally an Eagle, a Lion, a Dolphin, an Emeraud, and euery other noble creature, bringing by his goodnes and beauty, ſome profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to man, ſtirre him vp to praiſe the Creator, who gaue that goodneſſe and beauty to the creature. So the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments giuing grace, by that action of theirs, teſtifie to vs the merit of the Paſſion of Chriſt, meritorious ſpring of this grace. But aboue all Chriſtian Myſteries, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſice of the Maſſe excelleth; and that for two reaſons. The firſt, becauſe it containes in it preſent the ſame body, which redeemed vs vpon the Croſſe, and preſenteth in this body, the fountaine of our redemption. Whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments communicate nothing, but the Riuers flowing from that Fountaine. The ſecond, becauſe it liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents the action of this our redemption, to wit, the Paſſion of our Sauiour, and the Sacrifice of the Croſſe; for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16409:107"/>the ſame body, which was offered on the Croſſe, is offered heere; on the Croſſe, by bloudy Sacrifice; heere, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Sacrifice: on the Croſſe it was immolated; it is immolated alſo heere; but there with ſlaughter, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent effuſion of bloud; heere it is immolated after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we haue ſaid; to wit, the formes of bread and wine, and by them repreſented as a dead and inſenſible thing, ſuch as are bread and wine, and his bloud ſeeming to be after the manner of wine ſhed, vnder which it is; whereas it is alwayes in his body, and both body &amp; bloud remaine impaſſible, immortall and glorious. Vpon the Croſſe, his power ſeemed weakneſſe and infirmity; his goodneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and his wiſdome folly; for the wicked beheld him poore, beleeued him impotent, blaſphemed him as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, and derided him as a foole; though he was in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all powerfull, all good, all wiſe: all this is repreſented in the Sacrifice of the Maſſe. For in outward ſhew nothing appeares, but infirmity, to the eyes of Infidels, neither will they beleeue, that our Sauiour can make his body there preſent; it alſo ſeemes to them impiety, and therefore they call it Idolatry; it appeares to them nothing but folly, and therefore they mocke at it, as if it were a Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For theſe reaſons then, it honoreth, it prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it communicateth, it repreſents the vertue of the Croſſe, aboue all other Chriſtian myſteries: and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell for it was ordained by the hand of him, which hath of old drawne forth, in the old Sacrifices, all the Figures of the Croſſe; and who knew well, how to prepare a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Law of his Grace, which might liuely,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</note> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually repreſent the ſame Paſſion in euery point.

               <head>THE MIRACLE OF THE FIVE LOAVES, a Figure of the Euchariſt.</head>
               <p>THis wonderfull banquet, prepared in this Deſart, was a Picture of our Sacrament, as the Figures were, which euen now haue been declared: not ſo ancient for time, but wrought by the hand of a more cunning work-man. For the former Figures were anciently pictured indeed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of God, but by the hand and Penſell of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> this was the inuention of our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and freſhly drawne by his owne hand. Wherefore, thoſe former did ſignifie a farre off, and in diuers ſubiects, the Euchariſt, and the Author thereof; this is an entrance vnto it, and ſheweth it to bee neere at hand, becauſe it is done by the Author himſelfe, in proper perſon. The others ſet foorth our diuine myſtory, as the old Prophets foretold the Meſſias to come many yeares after; this heere did ſhew him in a manner preſent; as Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did point at our Sauiour with his finger. And therefore, as our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors note, the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> great Secretary, and moſt priuy to his Maſters intentions, before hee would ſet downe the Sermon, which our Sauiour made of the eating of his fleſh, ſets in the for efront the declaration of this miracle, as a peece of the ſame ſubiect, neceſſary for the vnderſtanding of that Sermon, and for the ſtranthening of our faith, concerning the Feaſt, which our Sauiour was to

By this method the ſupreame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath wiſely taught vs, tracing out by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, both by deeds and words, the way to the faith of this myſtery of his pretious body, working a miracle vpon the ſuſtenance, which was to be a ſigne thereof, and declaring to vs, the deſigne of the future banquet of his fleſh, to be after exhibited vnder the formes of bread. Behold now proportions and colours of the Picture.</p>

               <head>2. IN WHAT THE MIRACLE OF THE fiue Loaues did Figure the Euchariſt.</head>
               <p>THis miracle was a Figure of the Euchariſt in generall, becauſe it was a wonderfull refection, as that is of the Euchariſt: wonderfull in that it was cleane contrary to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common repaſts, which in the beginning are greateſt in quantity, and the longer the banquet continueth, the leſſe meat remaineth, till at laſt all be conſumed. Whereas heere contrariwiſe, in the beginning there was but a little meate, to wit, <hi>fiue Loaues and two Fiſhes;</hi> and the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereaſed more and more, the more it was diſtributed and eaten; and in the end of the Feaſt, there remained great aboundance. This wonder appeareth farre greater in the Euchariſt, in which one onely body of our Sauiour, hath ſufficed for all the Church, now more then ſixteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares; which multiplieth without being many, and is eaten without being conſumed. For if there be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Hoaſts conſecrated, it is in them all, and yet it is but one. And if it be receiued of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand mouthes, it is taken whole and entire of all, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there is, nor can bee conſumed of any. This is the firſt draught of the likenes that is betweene the miracle of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16409:112"/>fiue earthly loaues, &amp; our celeſtial bread, which is but one. The other ſmaller draughts are theſe: That miracle was made of bread, by the bleſſing of our Sauiour, it was done in the Deſart, it was prepared without labour, paine, or difficulty; it was diſtributed by the Apoſtles, and was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection giuen both to the ſoules and bodies; there is no doubt but faith, hope, and charitie, reuerence, religion, and other vertues, were planted in the hearts of many of them, when they beheld this admirable worke, done by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour for their good: herehence it was, that they would needs create him King. Theſe deſignes are expreſſed with liuely colours in the Euchariſt; for it is made of bread by the benediction of our Sauiour, who worketh ſecretly by his Almighty word, as a Maſter work-man in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is made in the Deſart of this life, for in the other there ſhall be no more Sacraments. It is made after a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, onely of bread and wine, and the words of Conſecration: whereas the ancient Sacrifices of the Iewes were made with paine and trauell, much killing, much waſhing and burning of the Victimes. And if ſome other ceremonies be vſed in the Maſſe; they are eaſie, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine rather to the decencie, then to the eſſence of the Sacrament and Sacrifice. In concluſion, this Sacrifice and Feaſt, is made by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles, and of Prieſts, ſucceeding them; and it ſerueth to plant and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the ſoule (as elſewhere we haue declared) Faith, Hope, Charity, Religion, and other diuine vertues, true food of our ſoules, and to giue vigour to our bodies, that they may riſe gloriouſly vpon the great day of the general reſurrection.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Euangeliſt makes no mention of any drinke in this miracle; it being probable, that as Manna was both meate and drinke, euen ſo were theſe Loaues and Fiſhes multiplied, which is alſo agreeable to the myſtery: for ſeeing, they that follow Ieſus Chriſt, are fiſhes, which naturally neuer drinke; theſe alſo need no drinke, being already become the Fiſhes of our Sauiour, beleeuing in him: albeit, the myſtery is yet greater, in that hereby is noted a rare fingularity of the holy Sacrament. For euen as Manna alone, the Loaues and the Fiſhes, did ſerue both for meate and drinke: So the Sacrament in one kinde is both meate and drinke, the body of our Sauiour ſeruing for both together, as did Manna, and thoſe Loaues and Fiſhes, Figures of it.</p>
               <p>Now for other circumſtances of this miracle, wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, firſt, that it was done in the Spring-time, vpon the euening, in the Deſart, before them which had heard, and followed our Sauiour, they being bidden to ſit vpon the graſſe. Theſe circumſtances teach vs, that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, was inſtituted in the ſpirituall Spring of the world,<note place="margin">

               <head>5. WHY THE PEOPLE WOVLD CREATE our Sauiour King, and why he fled them.</head>
               <p>THeſe people thus ſatisfied, were about to create our Sauiour King; not entreating him, but compelling him to accept the Royalty; which hee foreſeeing, ſtayed not vntill they came to him, but quickly withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from them, and fled into the Mountaine to pray. But from whence comes this deſire in theſe men, and wherfore did Ieſus Chriſt refuſe this honour, fithence that he was Prince of heauen and earth, and abſolute King, without dependance of any other? If for the miracle, they would haue made him King; wherefore had they not the ſame will, when they ſaw him caſt foorth diuels out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they poſſeſſed, and make thoſe mighty, wicked and rebellious ſpirits obedient to his Commandements? Why had they not the ſame will, when he commanded all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and maladies, and was obeyed? Making the blinde
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16409:114"/>to ſee, and the lame to goe, &amp;c. Theſe wonderfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, did not they alſo merit the ſame Diadem, which this refection in the Deſart did? In truth, if men conſider them in their greatneſſe, they merited a diuine reſpect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement; but this miracle had ſome particular thing, which moued theſe men to this deſire and deſigne. Firſt, it was a kind of miracle neuer heard of, before <hi>Moyſes</hi> had made Manna deſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, <hi>Elias</hi> had made the flower and oyle to encreaſe in fauour of the Widow; but <hi>Moyſes</hi> made not the Manna with his owne hands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>King.</hi> 17.14.16.</note> as our Sauiour wrought this miracle; and that which <hi>Elias</hi> did, he did not by his owne power, but receiued power of God to doeit. Our Sauiour multiplied theſe Loaues in his owne hands, and with his owne proper bleſſing; this made them beleeue that he could be no leſſe then the Meſſias, &amp; King promiſed to Iſrael; and for this cauſe they ſought for to declare him King. Secondly, the other miracles of our Sauiour were particular, principally effected for their good which were deliuered, and healed. This heere was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefit done in the ſight of all the multitude, and to the profit of euery one of them in particular, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them a generall deſire to acknowledge the ſame by conferring a publike honor vpon our Sauiour, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him their head, to whom they were ſo much obliged. Thirdly, they did acknowledge, that this refection was a benefit, worthy of a King. For the principall office of a King, is to guide and feed his ſubiects; for which cauſe they are compared to Feeders, and called Paſtors of the people. They would then haue proclaimed him King,<note place="margin">Eſay <hi>44.28.</hi> Homer.

But our Sauiour was not come to take vnto himſelfe any earthly Kingdome, but to eſtabliſh a ſpirituall Kingdome of his elect, who are the inheritance of his Church; in the which hee is King of the Iewes, and raigneth likewiſe in the hearts of

God alone can giue himſelfe to be eaten, he alone is almighty, not to bee exhauſted, vncapable of diminution. If then theſe things be ſo great; and if we beleeue and ſee heere that, which they neither ſaw nor beleeued; If wee ſee the prouidence of our Sauiour to gouerne and nouriſh all the

Why doe we not admire his benefits? Why doe we not magnifie them? Why doe wee not giue him immortall thankes for them? The multitude of his wonders, doe they dazell our eyes, as a bright lightning, or as the light of the Sunne? The continuall multiplying of his preſents, doth it make his great liberality leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to vs?

They erre then in three things: Firſt, in thinking the preſence of the fleſh of our Sauiour in this Sacrament to be carnall, for the preſence of a thing makes not the carnality, but the manner; his fleſh was trutly, and by reall preſence conceiued in the wombe of the Virgin: Yet was not that preſence carnall, becauſe the manner of the conception was from the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>When he aſcended into beauen, his body was preſent, in as many places of the beauens, as he did penetrate, the preſence was reall, but neuertheleſſe ſpirituall; becauſe it depended of a cauſe ſpirituall and diuine, and not naturall.

And as their faith is farthfull, ſo their eating is true: and contrariwiſe, the eating practiſed by theſe Heretikes in their Supper, is altogether carnall: for they take nothing heere more excellent, then bread, and neither doe they eath but bread; nor beleeue any thing, but what the faith of a Turke, of a Iew, and of a Pagan, all carnall, could not beleeue.

But what faith is yours, to beleeue nothing, except that, which ſenſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to you, or which your ſpirit comprehendeth? is it not the faith of a faithleſſe Philoſopher, which followes the courſe of the creature, altogether ignorant of the power of the Creator? And what iudgement is yours, to reiect the Catholike faith about this great myſtery, for not hauing the capacity to vnderſtand it? Seeing there haue been a thouſand things in Nature it ſelfe, that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers vnderſtood not? and for not vnderſtanding them, did they reiect them? But can you vnderſtand, how our Sauiour took humane fleſh, without the ſeed of man? how
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16409:130"/>our bodies, reduced into aſhes, ſhall riſe againe? How the bodies of the damned ſhall burne, without being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in eternall flames, and other myſteries of our faith? And if you beleeue theſe things, without vnderſtanding them, why beleeue you not this heere? If this ſeeme more difficult to you; ſo much the more haue you, wherein to admire the omnipotencie of God; and ſo much the more merit in beleeuing? If you beleeue, that God is Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, why doe you not beleeue, he can doe this, that he ſaith, who hath made the whole world by his onely word? If you beleeue him all wiſe, why beleeue you not, what hee hath ordained, is decreed with great wiſdome, albeit your iudgement cannot attaine to the ſecret of it? If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that hee is moſt good; why doe you not ſimply vſe the gift of his Maieſty? Wherefore ſay you, that it is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thing to haue his fleſh to eate, ſeeing he hath ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, as it may be really, and yet ſpiritually eaten? Are you not proud in your baſeneſſe; rather beleeuing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of your iudgement, then the greatneſſe of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe? Intollerable in your folly, condemning this, which his wiſdome ordained? Vngratefull in your vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, refuſing the meate, that he offers you for your health? O good Ieſus! O good Maſter! O good Paſtor! illuminate, teach, bring home theſe poore wanderers, theſe wicked diſciples, theſe ſtragling ſheepe, and preſerue vs in the ſollidity of thy holy faith, in the lap of our good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thy royall Spouſe, to receiue there alwayes the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy holy fleſh.

Expect vntill the morning, when hee ſhall bee euill entreated of Kings, of Prieſts, of people, and whipt after by all the worldly powers; when he ſhall be condemned, crowned, and crucified, as a theefe, as a tyrant, as a notable offender conuicted.

When men ſit downe at table, and when they riſe, they waſh their hands, and not their feet; and ſurely what reference hath our feet to our mouths, and the waſhing of them to eating: for if the waſhing of feete was to auoid the defiling of the bed, whereupon they were accuſtomed to receiue their food, they ſhould haue bin waſhed at the beginning, and before they ſate downe to the table for to eate the Lambe; after the eating wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they were to ſuppe. But now the beds are fouled alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and the feete of the Apoſtles are not become fouler, then they were, when they ſate downe to the table. What then ſignifieth this extraordinary waſhing? It ſheweth, that he, that will haue part and fruit, in the refection of our Sauiours body, ought not only to be cleane in mouth, and hand, as in common feeding, but moreouer in his feet; that is to ſay, he ought to be wholly cleanſed; he ought to bee pure and cleane, not onely in his actions and words, but alſo in his affections. The hand may well ſignifie workes; for it is the Inſtrument of inſtruments, and the <hi>Factotum</hi> both of ſpirit and body. The mouth is the mould of the word, and ſignifies it. The feete note to vs the affections of the ſoule; for as the corporall feete carry the body, ſo
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16409:135"/>the affections carry the ſoule, and are her feet. So the hand and mouth cleane, and the feet waſhed, are ſignes vnto vs of a man iuſt in his actions, diſcreet in his words, and pure in his affections; ſignes of a cleane man in euery point, and worthy of the refection of the body of our Sauiour. But who can attain to the perfection of this purity, amidſt the polluſions of this mortall life? He, whoſe feet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour will waſh: that, which to man is impoſſible, to the grace of God is moſt eaſie.

We haue formerly diſcourſed hereof in many precedent Figures, and namely, in that of Manna; it will bee ſufficient heere, to note the circumſtances of the preſent hiſtory, which eſpecially ſet forth the greatneſſe of it. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> beginning his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the waſhing of feete vpon the Eue of the Paſche, writeth thus, <hi>Ieſus knowing that his houre was come, that he ſhould paſſe out of this world to his Father: whereas he had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his, that were in the world, vnto the end hee loued them. And when Supper was done, whereas the Diuell now had put into the heart of</hi> Iudas Iſcariot <hi>to betray him: knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that hee came from God, and returned to God; he riſeth from Supper, and layeth aſide his garments.</hi> And that which followeth of the waſhing of feete: by which words Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> taught vs, that our Sauiour was now in the vigill of his Paſſion; that he had loued, and did conſtantly loue his owne; that he was the Sonne of God, hauing all things in his power. And by theſe preamples hee ſignified vnto vs, that in this Euening, ſo neare to his departure, hee was to make the concluſion of all his courſe by ſome notable acte, to the honor of his Father, and their good, whom he had loued ſo much. An action worthy of ſuch a Father, and of ſuch a Sonne, and of ſuch a Louer, all powerfull, all good, and all wiſe. A Sonne ſpares nothing to honor his Father; how liberall then will ſuch a Sonne be to ſuch a Father. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſerueth nothing from his children, that may tend to make them happy; and departing from them, hee leaueth them all the beſt that he hath.

And by the changing of the bread into his body, and of the wine into his bloud, which hee doth in this myſtery; he doth a proper act of an infinite power, and more noble, then the creation of the world. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the manner of the worke is worthy of God; ſo the Preſent is meſt magnificent, and of greater value then ten thouſand worlds: for it is the bady of a Prince, the body of a King, the body of God: and the Sacrifice made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is indeed a Sacrifice of Soueraigne honor, eſpecially being oſtered by ſuch a Prieſt, who is the Sonne of God himſelfe; and the food of this pretious body, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of giuing and taking it vnder the formes of bread and wine, is moſt agreeable to the wiſdome of the Giuer, and to the profit of the receiuers.

               </head>
               <p>THeſe words: <hi>This is my body,</hi> are moſt cleare; if there be any in the whole volume of the booke of God; and good reaſon they ſhould be cleare, For they containe the Law, and Inſtitution of thy greateſt Sacrament and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Faith, in ordaining whereof, it was fit to ſpeake clearely, and intelligibly, to the end to take away all occaſion of error in a matter of ſuch importance. They containe alſo the principal clauſe of the teſtament or Pact, which the Sonne of God did then make with his Church, wherein the Language which is vſed, ought to be proper, cleare and euident, and without doubtfulneſſe, ambiguitie, or incertainty, that the Will of the Teſtator may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without difficulty, and without contention.<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>26.</hi> Marke <hi>14.</hi> Luke <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> This is the cauſe, why three Euangeliſts, the Regiſters of this Inſtitution, and Notaries of this Teſtament, haue vſed the ſelfe-ſame words, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> after them, without varying.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> To the end to hold conſtant the light of this euidence, and ſtrongly to maintaine the ground of that faith, which wee ought to haue of this myſtery: and to declare by a firme and ſollide accord of foure diuine witneſſes, that the ſenſe of the words is that, which they literally ſignifie; and that being the words of an Almighty worker, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be impoſſible; and the words of a ſupreme truth, who can ſay nothing, which is not true; they muſt needs make that, which they ſignifie. By which meanes, if any one refuſing the literall ſenſe of the Scripture, will gloſe it from his owne head, ſaying, <hi>This is my body,</hi> that is to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16409:141"/>ſay, this is the Figure of my body; <hi>This is my bloud,</hi> that is, the Figure of my bloud; he ſhould herein be oppoſite to the holy depoſition of theſe foure witneſſes, not daring ſo to ſpeake, which notwithſtanding they would haue done, if ſuch had been the ſenſe of the words; and ſhould alſo too boldly change the truth of Gods word; giuing a ſenſe cleane contrary to the ſignification of the words, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Figure for the Body, againſt the authority of the forenamed witneſſes, who haue neuer preſumed to giue ſuch a gloſſe. Yea, hee ſhould doe contrary to all law of Speech and Grammer, which commandeth to take the words of the text, according to the ground of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning, without hauing recourſe to any metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and improper ſignification; when they do not giue any abſurde or contradictory ſenſe, which happeneth not here. For heere the proper ſenſe is moſt cominent and agreeable to the truth; and the words do ſignifie no other thing, but the preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in this Sacrament, which is not onely not contradictory, nor abſurde, but full of wonders, moſt worthy of the power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe of our Sauiour. When the Scripture calleth the King a <hi>Lion,</hi> the word ought to bee taken by ſimilitude, that a King is like a Lion, by reaſon of his royall magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity; for taking the word according to the ſenſe of the letter, the meaning ſhould be, that he were a beaſt, which would be falſe and abſurde. But theſe words, taken in their naturall ſignification, containe nothing, but that which is moſt agreeable to the Maieſty of the Creator, and moſt heneficiall to his creature; wherefore, there is not any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon heere to runne to Figures: and therefore alſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to ſay, that theſe clauſes, <hi>This is my body, This is my bloud,</hi> are improper ſpeeches, importing no more, then that they are Figures of his body and bloud. For ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation deſtroyes the truth of a moſt noble Sacrament, and ſhewes that ſuch Enterpreters are not onely void of faith, but alſo depriued of vnderſtanding; haſtily opening
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16409:141"/>the gate to themſelues, and to all other ſenſeleſſe people, to reiect all ſenſe of Scripture, be it neuer ſo euident, if it diſpleaſe them; and to frame the manner of it, according to the vnſteadineſſe of their owne braines, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant paſſion of vnbridled fleſh.</p>

The moſt excellent name of God is the <hi>Tetragram,</hi> expreſſed vnder the voice <hi>Idoney,</hi> compoſed of foure letters, not to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Iewes.

               <p>WHen our Sauiour made dis body Preſent in vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he offered it to his Father in an vnbloudy Sacrifice, after the forme of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and forth with he gaue it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16409:145"/>to his Apoſtles in Sacrament, vnder the ſame forme. This is the cauſe, why hauing ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> hee addeth, <hi>giuen for you,</hi> that is to ſay, offered for you in Sacrifice; <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you,</hi> now giuen and broken, and which ſhalbe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after giuen and broken in the ſame faſhion, euen till the end of the world, in remembrance of that bloudy Sacrifice, which to morrow I wil offer for you, once for all, vpon the Croſſe. So as our Sauiour made not his body onely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but preſent vnder the formes of bread, giuing it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of food, a dead being, albeit that in it ſelfe it was euer liuing, euen as in making himſelfe man, his Diuinity tooke a body, and a mortall being, and endured death in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, albeit the Diuinity was alwayes immortal, and endured nothing, as we haue declared before. He made himſelfe by reaſon of the dead ſpecies, preſent as dead, and repreſented himſelfe as a Victime, and as an offered Lambe, for to bee afterward the refection of the Father of the Family,<note place="margin">

And it imports not, as hath been ſaid heretofore, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vttered no words of Oblation expreſly, ſaying; My Father, I offer thee this body; the manner after which he makes himſelfe Preſent, as a Victime expreſſed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he offered himſelfe. It was alſo ſufficient, that hee made it Preſent, with intention to offer it to God, who ſeeth the heart, though the tongue ſay nothing. And ſo the Iewiſh Prieſts did offer their Sacrifices, immolating the the beaſts only, and ſaying no other thing, whereby to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that it was a Sacrifice. And ſo our Sauiour likewiſe offers himſelfe vpon the Croſſe, without vſing any words, fignifying Oblation.<note place="margin">

And it is, that our Sauiour carried himſelfe in his proper hands. A thing, which he eſteemed moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and impoſſible to haue been practiſed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> according to the ſence of the letter: But that our Sauiour only did it, when holding his body in his hand, and ſaying, <hi>This is my body,</hi> hee cetried it to his mouth, and gaue it to his Apoſtles. For though it might be that <hi>Dauid,</hi> playing the foole, carried himſelfe in his hands, by going on all foure, after the manner of little children; or bearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vp vpon his armes, and vſing them in ſtead of feet and of legges, after the faſhion of thoſe, who by actluity, caſt their body vpward in the ayre, with their head downward, like a tree, and walke vpon their hands. S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, had reaſon to ſay, that to cary himſelfe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his owne hands, belongeth only to our Sauiour; for it is he, which truly earieth himſelfe <hi>David</hi> caried not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on his hands, but rather on his hands and feet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be to be vnderſtood of the firſt manner; or only on his armes, if of the ſecond; but our Sauiour carieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe properly in his hands, neither more nor leſſe, then he caried in his band the meate, which he put in his mouth, or into the mouthes of others.</p>

Whereas Chriſtians in the Law of Grace, offer him a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice moſt acceptable in the higheſt degree, that is, the body &amp; bloud of the Meſſias himſelfe, paying, as it were, in his hand a full ſatisfaction, taken from that body and bloud, the faireſt payment that can be made; and praying the Father by the Sonne, which is the moſt vrgent prayer that can be imagined.

               <p>The ſecond part, which was the ſtate of the Moone, was no leſſe wiſely fulfilled. The Moone had fourteene dayes old vpon the euening of the Lambe; for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the month, was the fourteenth of the Moone, as the beginning of the month, was the beginning of the Moone, which hath been elſewhere declared.

Now the Moone on thurſday euening, which was the houre of the Paſche, being found in the Eaſt, and the Sunne in the Weſt; the next day at mid-noone, ſhee was ioyned face to face to the Sunne, in the ſame point of the <hi>Zodiak</hi> with him; and as ſhee ceaſed to ſhine vpon the earth, ſo by her interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhee made the Sunne to loſe his light, in ſuch ſort, as there were two admirable echpſes of the two great lights of heauen; &amp; by them was ſignified the departure of God from the Iewes, and the end of their Synagogue.

Euen ſo the Sonne of heauen, Creator of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sunne, from that day forward, retired the beames of his fauours from theſe vngratefull people, and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue eclypſed in her fourteenth day, that is, in her ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was depriued of the ſpirituall light, which ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from him, and was before communicated vnto her in the practiſe of her Ceremonies.

The Moone hath a generall reſemblance to the Church of God: for as the Moone takes all her light from the Sunne, and ſometimes goes before it, ſometimes comes after it, and ſometimes ioynes with it: ſo the Church ſhewes by the beames of the Sonne of God, going before him, according to his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, vntill the time of his Natiuity: being preſent with him while he remained vpon the earth; following him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, and ſometime ioyning her ſelfe to him by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and Reall Preſence of his body.

The newneſſe, and new manner, conſiſts in this, that ſhee drew neare to the Sun by an extraordinary meanes; for being on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſo farre from it, as the Eaſt from the Weſt, the next day ſhee was euen againſt it; which approachment ſhee ſhould not make, according to her naturall courſe, but in the ſpace of fourteene dayes, ſupernaturally alſo and with no leſſe wonder, ſhee returned to the Eaſt on Friday eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Sun-ſet, where ſhee had been the night before.

In theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in theſe wonders, happening neuer before, nor ſince, ſhee marketh out the Church in the ſtate of Grace, a ſtate of ſingular renouation, of a third ſeuenth, of a third time in the new Paſch, in the new and great Sacrifice and Feaſt, inſtituted by the Sonne of God in his body.

And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe walkes in this ſolitary Garden, to repaire the fault committed in the firſt Garden. In that the debt was made by diſobedience; in this it began to be paid by humility. In planting the firſt Garden, and the firſt tree of life, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16409:158"/>imployed his word, who commanded, and all was made; but in this it is not ſo; one houres ſtay in this will coſt thee thy bloud, O my ſweet Redeemer, and with the droppes of that pretious purple, the beds of this garden muſt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: And the Tree of Life, which thou haſt planted in the Paradiſe of thy Church, is not any meane effect, as that was, of thy holy word, but thy pretious body and bloud it ſelfe, accompanied with the aray of thy holy Diuinitie. O my Lord, what can I ſay to prayſe thy magnificency? I ſay, that thou art magnificent euery way; in taking and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, in feeding and in ſuffering euery way; good, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liberall of thy goods, and of thy ſelfe; euery way rich in mercy; and euery way aboundant in propitiation: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence it is, that for thy laſt retraite thou goeſt to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Oliuet, to make for vs, and to giue vnto vs the oyle of thy mercies; Oliues for vs, but Apples of anguiſh for thee. O my ſoule, thy Redeemer goeth in the night, and goeth to ſubiect himſelfe, for thee, to paines in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; doe ſomething for him; accompany him amidſt this darkneſſe; haue compaſſion on him; admire his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee; loath thy ſinnes, that haue caſt him into theſe vexations; weepe and pray with him; offer him thy heart and ſeruice in this perplexed high-way of his Agony. And fince thou art written in his Will, called to his Heritage, and placed at the Table of his Kingdome, to eate of his fruit of life; giue ſome ſigne of a grateful ſoule, and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſo many benefits; make him ſome preſent of thy gifts, that he hath giuen thee; and giue him ſomething of that, which he hath made thine; albeit thou art nothing, yet giue him thy ſelfe; in giuing thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſomething; giue thy ſelfe to him, ſince he hath giuen himſelfe to thee; and when I ſay himſelfe, what ſay I? an infinite depth of goodneſſe, giuen many wayes vnto thee; in his birth, in his conuerſation, in thy meate, in his death, and in all the kindes, that a thing can be giuen. After thou haſt contemplated, thanked, followed, and ſerued him in

For as the Altars of the Hebrewes were Figures of this Feaſt: ſo this Feaſt is the Image of the celeſtiall Table. Heere thou eateſt the bread of Angells; in heauen thou ſhalt alſo liue of the bread of Angels. Heere thy meat is God himſelfe, the ſelf-ſame God will be thy food at that Table there: the food is heere immortall; thy food there will be immortall. Hee, which hath of his owne free coſt and charges, prepared this Feaſt on earth, for the food of his Pilgrims, the ſelfe-ſame will prepare, according to his magnificency the Feaſt of felicity in heauen, for a glorious triumph of thoſe, who ſhall haue runne couragiouſly in the pathes of his diuine Lawes. Yet there is a difference. For in this Feaſt, nothing but faith ſoberly perceiues the ſauour of the meate, and the ſweetneſſe of the drinke; humane ſenſe and iudgement ſeeth nothing heere but couered diſhes, without power to touch them: In that there, the meate ſhall bee expoſed to the appetite of the ſoule to the full; in a magnificent and open table, and the ſenſes ſhall haue alſo their good part. In this heere we are mortall, growing in the Land of the dying, in that wee ſhall bee immortall, without feare of death or diſquiet, ſet in the poſſeſſion of the Land of the Liuing, and of the eternall kingdome; but who can vtter by word, or imagine by thought, the magnificency of that royall Feaſt?
